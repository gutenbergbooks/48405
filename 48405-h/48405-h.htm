History of Modern England<br /><br /></p>

<h2><a name="HIGH_POLITICS" id="HIGH_POLITICS">HIGH POLITICS</a></h2>

<p>Transition and growth, change and decay and reconstruction marked the
half-century covered in the previous three volumes. In the twenty-two
years that divide the return of the Liberals in 1892 from the "Grand
Smash" (as Mr. Page has called it) of 1914, these features are
intensified to an extent that renders the task of attempting even a
superficial survey perilous and intractable to one who is neither a
philosopher nor a trained historian. The wisest and sanest of those who
have lived through these wonderful times are too near their heights
and depths to view them in true perspective. Whatever merit attaches
to this chronicle is due to its reliance on contemporary opinion as
expressed in the pages of an organ of independent middle-class views.
It is within these limits a history of Victorians and post-Victorians
written by themselves.</p>

<p>"Full closes," unfashionable in modern music, are generally artificial
in histories. But the period on which we now enter did more than merely
coincide with the end of one century and the beginning of another.
It marked the passing of the Old Order, the passing of the Victorian
age: of the Queen, who, alike in her virtues and limitations, in the
strength and narrowness of her personality, epitomized most of its
qualities; and of the type of Elder Statesmen, of whom, with the sole
exception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> of Mr. Balfour, none remains at the moment as an active
force in the political arena. Of the Ministry of 1892-5 the only
survivor who mixes in practical politics is Mr. Asquith, but his record
as a legislator hardly entitles him to the name of an Elder Statesman
in the Victorian sense. Sir George Trevelyan, Lord Morley, Lord
Eversley and Lord Rosebery have all retired into seclusion. So, too,
with the Unionist Ministers who held office from 1895 to 1905. Veterans
such as Lord Chaplin, Lord George Hamilton and Lord Lansdowne enjoy
respect, but they do not sway public opinion, and are debarred by age
from active leadership and office. Lord Midleton stood aside to make
way for younger men when the Coalition Government was formed, and Lord
Selborne is perhaps the only Conservative statesman who held office
before 1906 who has any chance of sitting in a future Cabinet.</p>

<p>It was not only an age of endings; it was also an age of beginnings,
fresh and sometimes false starts, both as regards men and measures.
It witnessed the coming of the Death Duties in 1894, when Sir William
Harcourt's "Radical Budget," by equalizing the charges on real and
personal property, paved the way for the more drastic legislation
introduced by the Liberals in 1906 and the following years. This was
Harcourt's greatest achievement, and perhaps the most notable effort
in constructive policy of the short-lived Liberal administration; for
the second Home Rule Bill was dropped on its rejection by the Peers.
Under the Unionist administrations of 1895-1905 Mr. Joseph Chamberlain,
as Colonial Secretary, and Mr. Wyndham, by his Irish Land Purchase
Act, rendered conspicuous service in the domain of Imperial and Home
policy. Yet at the culminating point of his popularity Mr. Chamberlain
left the Government to prosecute that Fiscal Campaign which broke up
the Government, broke down his strength, and ended a brilliant career
in enforced retirement. Mr. Wyndham's withdrawal from the Government,
owing to friction over Irish policy, closed in early middle age the
career of the most gifted and attractive politician of his generation.</p>

<p class="center">"IL GIOCONDO"</p>
<p>The enigmatic smile of this Old Master distinguishes it from that other
National treasure, the "Bonar Lisa."</p>
</div>

<p>From 1906 onwards we are confronted by the meteoric and Protean
personalities of Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Winston <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>Churchill, who
between them have held almost all the great offices of State, and
ranged over the whole spectrum of Party colours, and lastly of Lord
Birkenhead. Mr. Churchill's father had once called Mr. Gladstone "an
old man in a hurry." One wonders what Lord Randolph would have called
his son Winston, of whom it was said "he likes things to happen, and
when they don't happen he likes to make them happen." In comparison
with the discreet progress of Reform in the last century the pace
became fast and furious. The demands of organized Labour were conceded
in the Trade Disputes Bill of 1906&mdash;the greatest landmark in industrial
legislation of the last half-century&mdash;and in 1910 the People's Budget
led to the revolt and surrender of the House of Lords.</p>

<p>Yet concurrently with the democratic drift of Liberal finance and
social reform, the principle of a continuity of foreign policy,
initiated by Lord Rosebery, and continued by Lord Salisbury and Lord
Lansdowne, was faithfully maintained by Sir Edward Grey, whose sober
and frugal expositions contrasted strangely with the vivacity and
flamboyant rhetoric of his colleagues. The Anglo-French <em>Entente</em> and
the Anglo-Japanese Alliance both came into being when Lord Lansdowne
was at the Foreign Office, and the influence of the Liberal Imperialist
group in Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Cabinet secured a free hand for
the Foreign Minister. It is the fashion in some quarters to regard the
late King Edward as "the only begetter" of the <em>Entente</em>; it is at any
rate within the mark to credit him with having missed no opportunity of
fostering it by his tact and <em>bonhomie</em>. It was no easy task. When he
visited Paris in 1902 the official greetings were perfectly correct,
but the animosity aroused over the Boer war found vent in outrageous
and unseemly caricatures. England was then the most unpopular country
in the world; and in allaying this general distrust and dislike, the
personal relations of King Edward with foreign statesmen and rulers
wrought powerfully for goodwill and a better understanding.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Foes and Friends</em></div>

<p>Looking back, in the light of fuller knowledge, on the South African
war of 1899-1902, we cannot fail to recognize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> how narrowly we escaped
the active hostility of more than one European Power; how much we owe
to the wise magnanimity of the British Government in granting full
autonomy to the Transvaal in 1906&mdash;an act not only justified by the
sequel but approved by those who voted against it. It converted the
most formidable of those who fought against us into loyal servants of
the Empire in her hour of greatest need; it allayed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> misgivings
of those at home who had opposed the Boer war, and it silenced the
criticisms of foreigners who had denounced our aim as the extermination
of a people rightly struggling to be free. Whatever views may be held
as to the origin of the Boer war&mdash;that it was forced on by mining
magnates, or that it was the inevitable result of a reactionary system
which threatened our hold on South Africa&mdash;it remains one of the very
few examples of a war which, in the long run, left things better than
they had been, and satisfied the aspirations of the majority of the
conquered. And if we did not learn all the lessons that we might have
learned from the military point of view, the experience was not thrown
away. The services of Kitchener, Plumer and Byng, to mention only three
out of scores of names, proved that what was comparatively a little war
was a true school of leadership for the greatest of all.</p>

<p>Great Britain's warlike operations throughout this period were
intra-Imperial, and the scale of the South African campaign, in which
from first to last we put 250,000 men into the field, dwarfed the
troubles in Ashanti and on the Indian frontier into insignificance.
That we kept out of all the other wars which convulsed the world
between 1892 and 1914 must be put down to good management as well as
good luck. It is remarkable to notice the steady if gradual convergence
of the war clouds on Europe, the drawing in of the war zone from the
circumference to the centre, beginning with the conflict between China
and Japan. The brief and inglorious Greco-Turkish war hardly counts,
and Europe was not physically engaged in the Spanish-American war,
where all the fighting was done in the New World. Politically its
significance was far-reaching, as revising the Monroe Doctrine and
enlarging the Imperial horizons of the United States. Politically,
again, the "Boxer" rising in China affected the European Powers, whose
competing interests in the "integrity of China" were not reconciled by
their joint expedition for the relief of the Legations in 1900. Here
again the fighting was in the Far East, as it was in the Russo-Japanese
war, if we except the "regrettable incident" of the Dogger Bank; and
Russia has always been as much an Oriental as a Western Power. But the
Russo-Japanese war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> shook Tsardom to its foundations, promoted Japan
to the status of a Great Power, and compensated her largely for the
intervention of Russia, Germany and France in robbing her of the spoils
of her victory over China. The European conflagration broke out in
1912 with the war of the Balkan League on Turkey. Victory crowned the
efforts of a righteous cause&mdash;the relief of oppressed nationalities
from the oppressions and exactions of a corrupt and tyrannous rule&mdash;but
was wasted by the internecine quarrels and irreconcilable demands of
the victors. Serbia, who had lived down much of the odium excited by
the barbarous murders of Alexander and Draga, and had borne more than
her share of the war against Turkey, was isolated, partly by her own
intransigence, mainly by the greed, the diplomatic manoeuvres and
the treachery of her allies, and in her isolation fell a victim to the
dynastic ambitions of Austria. The assassination of the Crown Prince
Ferdinand at Sarajevo was the excuse for Austria's ultimatum to Serbia,
the proximate cause of the Great War of 1914. Whether engineered
in Vienna or not, the murder secured the removal of an heir whose
succession to the throne of Austria-Hungary was looked upon with grave
suspicion by a powerful group in Austria who had no desire to upset the
House of Hapsburg but profoundly distrusted the Crown Prince. In the
homely phrase Sarajevo killed two birds with one stone. It eliminated
an uncertain and unpopular prince, and furnished Austria with an
opportunity for gratifying her long-standing hostility to Serbia. But
there was a third and bigger bird; for the complicity of Germany in
dispatching the Ultimatum is no matter for surmise. Without her support
and pressure it would never have been sent.</p>

<p class="center">THE ROAD TO RUIN</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Punch on World Politics</em></div>

<p>Confronted on all sides by problems of such magnitude and far-reaching
importance, it is not to be wondered at if <em>Punch</em>&mdash;primarily a comic
journal&mdash;failed to gauge their full significance, or to preserve an
attitude of inflexible consistency in his comments. There was always
a certain divergence between his editorial policy as expressed in the
cartoons and the comments of individual members of his staff. This
elasticity made for impartiality in the main; but it became somewhat
perplexing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> at the time of the Boer war, when a general support of
the Government was combined with very sharp criticism of Lord Milner.
Yet if <em>Punch</em> here and elsewhere spoke with more than one voice, his
views on high policy, international relations and home affairs exhibit
a certain general uniformity and continuity. He supported both the
<em>Entente</em> and the alliance with Japan. The spasm of irritation over the
Fashoda incident soon passed; he resented the intervention of Russia
and Germany which robbed Japan of the fruits of her victory over China,
and his sympathies were unmistakably with Japan in the war with Russia.
<em>Punch</em> was consistently and increasingly critical of the Kaiser, while
perhaps over-ready to dissociate his temper from that not only of the
German people but of the educated classes; he was also consistently
alive to the menace of German competition in naval armaments and trade,
though by no means disposed to acquit British merchants and workmen
from a provocative lethargy. Towards America, <em>Punch's</em> attitude
shows a progressive benevolence. The Venezuela incident and President
Cleveland's message at the beginning of this period brought us within
measurable distance of a rupture, happily averted by negotiation, as
the later and less serious difficulty over the Alaska boundary was
averted by arbitration. One may fairly say that <em>Punch's</em> relief at
the pacific adjustment of these outstanding questions was far greater
than his sensitiveness on the point of national honour. He did not
refrain from the use of the word "filibustering" in connexion with
the Spanish-American war, in which the gallantry of Cervera went far
to enlist sympathy on the beaten side; but with the accession to the
Presidency of Mr. Roosevelt, a man in many ways after <em>Punch's</em> own
heart, though not exempt from criticism for his controversial methods,
a friendlier tone became apparent, and the historic "indiscretion" of
Admiral Sims's speech at the Guildhall in 1910 helped to create the
atmosphere of goodwill which rendered possible the fulfilment of his
prophecy.</p>

<p>On National Defence and the maintenance of our naval supremacy <em>Punch</em>
continued to speak with no uncertain voice. He applauded Lord Roberts's
patriotic but neglected warnings and his advocacy of universal military
service, and lent a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> friendly but not uncritical approval to the
Territorial Army scheme.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recruiting Sergeant Punch</span>: "No, Sir. The fact is, Mr. Bull, if

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Gladstonian Home Rule</em></div>

<p>In regard to Ireland and Home Rule, after the rejection of the Home
Rule Bill of 1893 <em>Punch's</em> independent support of the Liberals gave
place to a general support of the Unionist policy, tempered by a more
or less critical attitude towards Ulster. He cannot be blamed for
neglecting to note the obscure and academic beginnings of the Sinn Fein
movement, or for failing to forecast that triple alliance of Sinn Fein
with the old physical force party and the Labour extremists under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Larkin which led to the rebellion of Easter, 1916. The Government
expert, who devoted seven years to the neglect of his duties, was
sunk in unholy ignorance of all that was going on until the explosion
took place. For the rest, <em>Punch</em> became increasingly critical of
the demands of Labour and the parochial outlook of its leaders;
increasingly antagonistic to the measures passed in satisfaction of
those demands. At the same time he devoted more space than ever to
satirizing, ridiculing, and castigating the excesses, extravagances
and eccentricities of "smart" society, the week-end pleasure hunt of
the idle rich, and all the other features which may be summed up in
the phrase, "England de Luxe." Pictorially his record reveals perhaps
more amusement than disgust at the carnival of frivolity which reached
its climax in the years before the war. The note of misgiving is not
lacking, but it is sounded less vehemently than in the 'eighties of the
last century. In the main <em>Punch's</em> temper may be expressed, to borrow
from Bagehot, as an "animated moderation."</p>

<p>To turn from outlines to details, one is confronted in 1893 with Mr.
Gladstone's second attempt to solve a problem which Giraldus Cambrensis
pronounced insoluble seven centuries ago. <em>Punch's</em> earlier cartoons
on the Home Rule Bill are negligible, but the difficulties of the
Premier's position are aptly shown in the picture of Gladstone as a
knight in armour on a perilous pathway between the Irish Nationalist
bog and the "last ditch" of Ulster. The accompanying text, modelled
on Bunyan, represents Mr. Gladstone as a Pilgrim relying as much on
tactics as the sword. The most genial reference to Ulster is that in
which she figures as the Widow Wadman asking Uncle Toby, "Now, Mr.
Bull, do you see any 'green' in my eye?" and Uncle Toby protests he
"can see nothing whatever of the sort." Otherwise <em>Punch's</em> attitude is
unsympathetic, witness the use of the term "Ulsteria" and the epigram
on the second reading of the Bill, put, it is true, into the mouth of
"A rebellious Rad":&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>In the "Essence of Parliament" little is said of the arguments,
but we get a glimpse of Lord Randolph Churchill's
return to the political arena and echoes of the unbridled
loquacity of Mr. Sexton. The cartoons are more instructive,
notably that on the introduction of the "Guillotine" by Gladstone,
with the G.O.M. as chief operator, Harcourt and
Morley as republican soldiers, and Amendments, as heads,
falling into a waste-paper basket. The fate of the measure is
neatly hit off in the "Little Billee" cartoon; Home Rule as
"Little Billee" is about to be massacred by the House of Lords,
represented by Salisbury and Hartington as chief villains.
"Little Billee" in the legend not only survived but attained
high distinction in after life; but it is hard to say whether
<em>Punch</em> implied a similar resurrection for the Bill of 1893. But
whatever were his views on the merits of Home Rule, <em>Punch</em>
was decidedly critical of the Government's naval policy, and
when Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Morley had simultaneously made
seemingly irreconcilable speeches on the subject, he adroitly
invoked the shade of Cobden, who had, in certain conditions,
proclaimed himself a Big Navyite. <em>Punch</em> fortified the
argument by a set of verses headed "Rule Britannia" and
ending with this stanza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w30"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Devotion to the needs of home</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Mr. Gladstone and his Successor</em></div>

<p>Yet when Mr. Gladstone resigned the premiership, early in 1894,
<em>Punch's</em> tribute is an unqualified eulogy of the "Lancelot of our
lists":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

</div></div></div>

<p>The "last stroke" referred to was doubtless the speech in which Mr.
Gladstone uttered his warning to the Lords, a warning translated into
action by the Parliament Act of 1910. Lord Rosebery, his successor,
came from the gilded chamber, and, in spite of his democratic record
and brilliant gifts, was not enthusiastically welcomed by the Liberal
Party. But <em>Punch</em> had no misgivings at the moment and acclaimed
him in a cartoon in which he enters the lists, "from spur to plume
a star of tournament," with Harcourt as his squire, a reading of
their relations hardly borne out by the sequel. The Cabinet were not
a "band of brothers," and, as we have said above, the most notable
legislative feature of the Liberal administration was the "Radical
Budget" of Sir William Harcourt. <em>Punch's</em> comment, in the cartoon "The
Depressed Dukes" and the verses on "The Stately Homes of England,"
combined prescience with a touch of malice. The Duke of Devonshire
is shown saying to the Duke of Westminster, "If this Budget passes,
I don't know how I am going to keep up Chatsworth,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> and the Duke of
Westminster replies, "If you come to that, we may consider ourselves
lucky if we can keep a tomb over our heads." Mr. Chamberlain's famous
phrase about "ransom" is recalled, in view of his <em>rapprochement</em>
to the Tories, to illustrate his falling away from Radicalism, and
<em>Punch's</em> references to him are, for a while, critical to the verge of
hostility. Sambourne's picture of the interesting development of the
"Josephus Cubicularius (orchidensis)" exhibits his evolution from the
manufacturer of screws, the republican and the radical, to the patriot,
society pet, and full-blown Conservative with a peerage looming in
the future; while in the "Essence of Parliament" he is ironically
complimented on investing the High Court of Westminster with "the tone
and atmosphere of the auction-room."</p>

<p>On the other hand, <em>Punch</em> recognized that a disposition to add to our
Imperial responsibilities was no longer a Tory monopoly. Uganda was
annexed in 1894, and John Bull is seen finding a black baby on his
doorstep: "What, <em>another</em>! Well, I suppose I must take it in," the
explanatory verses being headed "<em>Prestige oblige</em>." The assassination
of President Carnot prompts a tribute to France:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

<p class="i0">Sister in sorrow now as once in arms,</p>
<p class="i0">Of old fair enemy in many a field&mdash;</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>an obvious adaptation of Sir Philip Sidney's "that sweet enemy France."
But in the realm of foreign affairs the most striking event was the
Chino-Japanese war. Here <em>Punch's</em> sympathies are clearly revealed in
his cartoon, "Jap the Giant-killer," with an up-to-date fairy-tale
text; in the picture of Japan as the Infant Phenomenon lecturing on
the Art of War to John Bull, Jonathan, the Kaiser and other crowned
heads; and in the condemnation of the jealous intervention of Russia
and Germany to rob Japan, who had "played a square game," of the fruits
of victory. The death of the Tsar Alexander III in November, 1894, is
commemorated in a cartoon in which Peace is chief mourner. <em>Punch</em>, as
we have seen, had not been enthusiastic over the gravitation of Russia
towards a French alliance; but no official declaration of its existence
was made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> until 1897, though it was mentioned publicly by M. Ribot in
1895.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Seven Lord Roseberys</em></div>

<p>The Rosebery Cabinet resigned in June, 1895. <em>Punch's</em> admiration
for Lord Rosebery had steadily waned during his brief tenure of the
Premiership, and distrust of his versatility is revealed in the
versified comment on Mr. St. Loe Strachey's article in the <em>Nineteenth
Century</em>. There the "Seven Ages of Rosebery" are traced, in the manner
of Jaques, from the Home Ruler onward through the phase of London
County Council chairman to Premier, and Sphinx <em>à la</em> Dizzy, ending:&mdash;</p>

<p>Lord Salisbury's third Cabinet was reinforced by the inclusion of
the Liberal-Unionists&mdash;the Duke of Devonshire, Mr. Goschen and Mr.
Chamberlain. It was a powerful combination, but suffered in the long
run from the inherent drawbacks of all coalitions, though the course
of events postponed the inevitable disruption. Before the Liberals
left office, Mr. Gladstone had emerged from his retirement to denounce
the "Armenian Atrocities" and urge British intervention. Here, as in
earlier years, <em>Punch</em> sided with the advanced Liberals, rejoiced
in his well-known cartoon, "Who said 'Atrocities'?" that there was
life in the old dog (Mr. Gladstone) yet; welcomed the adhesion of the
Duke of Argyll to Mr. Gladstone's campaign in another cartoon of the
"Old Crusaders: Bulgaria, 1876, Armenia, 1895"; and denounced the
unchangeable ferocity of the Turk. When the Bishop of Hereford invited
his clergy to send up petitions respecting the Armenian atrocities,
one vicar refused to protest against Turkish crimes, on the ground
that the English Government was exercising all its ingenuity to
persecute and plunder Christians here. This referred to the Liberal
Government's Welsh Disestablishment Bill. <em>Punch</em> ironically declared
that the vicar's logic was as convincing as his Christian sympathy was
admirable. On the return of the Unionists to power, <em>Punch</em> continued
to urge strong measures, and lamented the powerlessness of the "Great
Powers" to bring about reforms in Turkish administration.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Kiel Canal</em></div>

<p>The retirement of Mr. Peel from the Speakership afforded <em>Punch</em> a
fitting opportunity for recognizing his great qualities in maintaining
the dignity of his position, his "awesome mien and terrible voice" in
administering rebukes, and for joining in the chorus of congratulation
to the new Conductor of the Parliamentary Orchestra, Mr. Gully. As
for the protest of Lord Curzon, Lord Wolmer and Mr. St. John Brodrick
against the exclusion of peers from the House of Commons, <em>Punch</em> dealt
faithfully with the movement in his comments on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> "Pirate Peers."
Better still is the cartoon in which a bathing woman addresses a little
boy wearing a coronet, and battering with his toy spade at the door
of a bathing-machine labelled House of Commons. "Come along, Master
Selborne," she says, "and take your dip like a little nobleman." This
incident of May, 1895, is hardly worth mentioning save as an example
of self-protective insurance against future legislation aimed at
the power of the Upper House. For years to come <em>Punch's</em> political
preoccupations were almost exclusively with questions of Imperial
policy and international relations. The opening of the Kiel Canal
practically coincided with the return to power of Lord Salisbury, and
is celebrated by <em>Punch</em> in the same number in which he ironically
adapts Shakespeare's <em>Coriolanus</em> to illustrate the alliance of Lord
Salisbury and Mr. Chamberlain. <em>Punch's</em> representative went out on
the <em>Tantallon Castle</em> with Mr. Gladstone, and gives a lively account
of the junketings on board and on shore, and the entertainment of
sovereigns and local magnates. In more serious vein <em>Punch</em> editorially
hails the canal as a "Path of Peace," banishing misgivings and
remembrances of Denmark and France:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

<p class="i0">And the Canal be a new Path of Peace.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>A couple of months later our friendly relations with Italy inspired a
cartoon in which Britannia congratulates Italy, but advises her to be
less visionary and more practical. Italy's finances were causing her
trouble; otherwise the advice showed an inability to sound the springs
of Italian policy. <em>Punch's</em> pacific dreams were dispelled in the
autumn by the renewed troubles in Ashanti. Britannia, as he put it,
expected more than an umbrella this time; King Coffee's umbrella had
cost us £900,000 in 1874. Happily the expedition was well organized
and its immediate purpose executed, though a further expedition became
necessary in 1900. Far graver anxieties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> threatened us from Africa at
the close of the year, and since <em>Punch's</em> criticisms of and comments
on the successive phases of controversy and conflict betray a certain
amount of variation and even inconsistency, it is as well to point
out that the unfriendly tone he had shown towards "Joe" in previous
years had largely abated upon Mr. Chamberlain's accession to office
as Colonial Secretary. In the account of a dinner held in the late
autumn of 1895 to celebrate the opening of railway communication
between Natal and the Cape, Mr. Chamberlain's speech is extolled as
"splendidly pitched, admirably phrased, and full of the Palmerstonian
ring." Simultaneously in "The Imperial Federalists' Vade Mecum" <em>Punch</em>
discourses on the difficulties, no longer insuperable, which attended
on the translation into reality of that dream of Imperial Federation
which had once been regarded as a nightmare.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Dr. Jameson's Popularity</em></div>

<p>The abortive Jameson Raid at the close of December, 1895, came as
a bombshell; and <em>Punch</em>, in his "Tug of War" cartoon, shows the
Uitlander trying to pull the British Lion into the Transvaal, while
Mr. Chamberlain is pulling him back. Canning's well-known lines on
"The Pilot that weathered the Storm" are rewritten in honour of Mr.
Chamberlain's handling of the crisis. A few months earlier <em>Punch</em> had
ridiculed the Kaiser for his arbitrary absolutism in sending to prison
a private University teacher "for writing in praise of a certain kind
of soap." The famous telegram to President Krüger was dealt with more
audaciously in an apocryphal letter purporting to have been sent by the
Queen to her grandson:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mein lieber Willy</span>,&mdash;Dies ist aber über alle Berge. Solch
eine confounded Impertinenz have ich nie gesehen. The fact of the
matter is that Du ein furchtbarer Schwaggerer bist. Warum kannst
Du nie ruhig bleiben, why can't you hold your blessed row? Musst
Du deinen Finger in jeder Torte haben? Was it for this that I made
you an Admiral meiner Flotte and allowed you to rig yourself out in
einer wunderschönen Uniform mit einem gekokten Hut? If you meant mir
any of your blooming cheek zu geben why did you make your grandmamma
Colonel eines Deutschen Cavallerie Regiments? Du auch bist Colonel
of a British Cavallerie Regiment, desto mehr die Schade, the more's
the pity. Als Du ein ganz kleiner Bube warst have ich Dich oft
tüchtig gespankt, and now that you've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> grown up you ought to be
spanked too.... Du weist nicht wo Du bist, you dunno where you are,
and somebody must teach you. Is Bismarck quite well? Das ist ein
kolossaler Kerl, nicht wahr? So lange. Don't be foolish any more.</p>

<p class="psalute">Deine Dich liebende,</p>

<p class="pauthor"><span class="smcap">Grandmamma</span>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This was followed up by the picture of the Kaiser as "Fidgety Phil."
But <em>Punch</em> was already alive to the widespread hostility to England
which prevailed on the Continent, and did not shrink from suggesting
that we were ready at need to take up the challenge. He admitted the
popularity of "Dr. Jim," but irony underlies his dialogue between the
dubious Londoner, who asks:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"How will they treat this Doctor Jim,</p>
<p class="i2">Who doesn't return a winner?"&mdash;</p>

<p>and the Hearty Citizen who replies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"There's only one way of treating <em>him</em>."&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">"And that is?"&mdash;"Give him a dinner."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p><em>Punch</em> is ironically sympathetic, again, in his comment on the
statement that "About 130 letters awaited Dr. Jameson ... many of
them containing offers of marriage." A few months later, however,
<em>Punch</em> supported the demand for his release on account of ill-health.
The cartoon based on Mr. Rhodes's resignation in May is headed,
"The Pity of it." South Africa (as Othello) says to him: "Cassio, I
love thee; but never more be officer of mine." <em>Punch</em> adds as his
authority a statement in <em>The Times</em>: "Mr. Rhodes has no longer any
power of assailing or menacing the Transvaal. The military authority
in the Company's territory is in the hands of Sir Richard Martin.
The administration is in the hands of Lord Grey." It was about the
same time that <em>Punch</em> published a design for a statue of Krüger, in
which the British Lion is shown in chains while Chamberlain kneels
obsequiously to the President.</p>

<p>South Africa was not our only source of anxiety in 1896. Indeed,
it may be said to have temporarily receded into the background as
a storm centre. For our strained relations with the United States
over the Venezuelan arbitration had been brought to a critical stage
by President Cleveland's message. The conciliatory speeches of Mr.
Chamberlain and Mr. Balfour in January led <em>Punch</em> to represent them
in the act of placating the American Eagle with caresses and sugar.
He was better inspired in his open letter to Mr. W. D. Howells, the
distinguished American writer, recognizing his generous and courageous
efforts to create a better mutual understanding between the two
countries. In particular he saluted the "Golden words" in which Mr.
Howells criticized his own countrymen:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Letter to Mr. Howells</em></div>

<blockquote>

<p>"What I chiefly object to in our patriotic emotion, however, was
not that it was so selfish but that it was so insensate, so stupid.
It took no account of things infinitely more precious than national
honour, such as humanity, civilization, and</p>

<p class="center">
'the long result of time'</p>

<p>which must suffer in a conflict between peoples like the English and
the Americans. For the sake of having our ships beat their ships, our
poor fellows slaughter their poor fellows, we were all willing, for
one detestable instant at least, to have the rising hopes of mankind
dashed, and the sense of human brotherhood blunted in the hearts of
the foremost people of the world."</p>

<p>But is there, as you say, "in the American heart a hatred of England,
which glutted itself in her imagined disaster and disgrace when we
all read the President's swaggering proclamation, in which he would
not yield to the enemy so far as even to write good English"? Is
there to be no forgiveness, are we never to cancel old scores and
begin our international book-keeping, if I may so term it, on a clean
page? I do not think our people hate yours. Your dash, your pluck,
your humour, your keen common sense, your breezy and inexhaustible
energy, your strength and broad capacity for government, all these
qualities command and obtain from us a sincere tribute of admiration.
If you hate us, we must submit to that melancholy condition, but never
submit in such a fashion as to cease from honest effort to abate
and in the end to remove all hatred. Blood, as one of your naval
captains<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1.">[1]</a> said on a memorable occasion, is thicker than water. So
saying, he dashed in to the help of our sorely pressed ships. Let us
then call a truce to petty and malignant carping, and join hands in
an alliance dependent not upon written treaties, but upon the noble
sympathy of two great nations engaged in the same work of civilization
and progress. You, Sir, speaking for others, I trust, as well as for
yourself, have set us an example.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It was in the same spirit that <em>Punch</em> welcomed a remark in the New
York <em>Morning Press</em>: "After all the English people are our people,
and we are theirs," and deprecated as suicidal any efforts to forsake
a common heritage and rend asunder a family tree. The tension passed,
thanks to diplomacy and arbitration, and towards the close of the year
we find <em>Punch</em> welcoming Mr. McKinley on his election as President,
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> Shade of Washington (with a somewhat bulbous nose) congratulating
Columbia: "'Sound Money' is the best policy." Meanwhile the expedition
to Khartum had been decided on; the House of Commons, reassured by a
confident speech from Mr. Chamberlain, having approved of the forward
policy by a two to one vote, in spite of the misgivings of Mr. Morley,
Sir William Harcourt and Sir Charles Dilke. <em>Punch</em>, mindful of 1884,
registered his approval in the cartoon in which the Shade of Gordon
in the desert utters the one word, "Remember!" Wars and rumours of
wars did not distract <em>Punch's</em> attention from the peaceful rivalry of
commerce. He was still much concerned by Germany's competition, which
he typified in his cartoon of British Trade as the old woman whose
petticoats were "cut all round about," while she was asleep, by a
German pedlar. And the commercial significance of Li Hung Chang's visit
is not overlooked in the generally farcical handling of that extremely
astute Oriental. In the cartoon "China in the Bull Shop," rival
Continental shopkeepers, who had got no orders out of him, are consumed
with envy and curiosity. If <em>Punch</em> is to be believed, their envy was
ill-founded. Li Hung Chang displayed a boundless inquisitiveness,
but there was "nothing doing" in the way of business between him and
his hosts. <em>Punch</em> drew mainly on his imagination for the events of
the visit, and ascribed to Li Hung Chang a number of topical Chinese
proverbs. The best of them&mdash;"Half an official welcome is better than an
ill-bred mobbing"&mdash;refers to his arrival in the "dead" season.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Two Modern Hamlets</em></div>

<p>Lord Rosebery resigned the leadership of the Liberal Party in June.
While still in office he had estranged the Radical stalwarts by his
Imperialist foreign policy and his heretical view of the necessity of
converting the "predominant partner," England, before attempting to
revive Home Rule. His Government, as one of his colleagues put it, were
condemned to the task of "ploughing the sands." In the intervening year
the gulf that severed him from the stalwarts and the Nonconformist
conscience had been widened by his refusal to join in Mr. Gladstone's
Armenian crusade, and henceforth he decided to "plough a lonely
furrow." In later years he made occasional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> dramatic interventions,
but his official career, like that of his contemporary at Eton, Lord
Randolph Churchill, closed before he was fifty.</p>

<p>Our relations with the United States were bettered at the opening
of 1897 by the signing of the Arbitration Treaty adjusting the
Venezuelan question. In Europe events did not conduce to diminish
our unpopularity. It was the year of the brief Greco-Turkish war,
which revived old divisions of opinion at home. <em>Punch</em> was no lover
of the Turk; he realized the difficulties of King George, whom he
depicted as Hamlet at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> Athens, recognizing (like Lord Rosebery) that
the "time was out of joint" and deploring "the cursed spite that he
was ever born to set it right"; but he supported Lord Salisbury in
severely rebuking the hundred M.P.'s who had sent the King a message of
encouragement. The verses, modelled on Tennyson's "Charge of the Light
Brigade," disparaged the message as mere gaseous talk, which did not
mean business, and was bound to end in smoke. Criticism of the Kaiser
becomes more animated than moderate; the frequent prosecutions for
<em>lèse-majesté</em>, and the famous pamphlet, in which Professor Quidde of
Munich ingeniously satirized the Kaiser's megalomania in an historical
essay on the aberrations of Caligula, inspire a caustic open letter
to Wilhelm II, the gist of which is that, though old enough to know
better, he was still the victim of the capricious extravagance of
youth:&mdash;</p>

lifting his glass and crying, "Hoch! Hoch! Hoch!" amid the clatter of
swords and the admiring shouts of a profusely-decorated soldiery. Now
I know that a stout gentleman is doing these things, and reducing his
hearers to an abyss of melancholy at his dismal failure in dignity. A
boy who played fantastic tricks with the telegraph-wires incurred but
a mild censure. What shall be said of a middle-aged and pompous party
whose pleasure it is to play practical jokes that set two nations by
the ears?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The "Raid" and its Aftermath</em></div>

<p>Yours is a great inheritance, greatly won by heroic deeds. Your
people are by nature the mildest and most loyal, and by tradition and
education the most thoughtful, in Europe. But mild and loyal as they
are their minds must rise in revolt against a sovereign who reproduces
in the crudest form the stale theories of divine right and arbitrary
government, whose one notion of administration is to increase his
stupendous military forces by taxation while diminishing the number
of his reasonable critics by imprisonment. You have travelled, cocked
hat in hand, to capital after capital, you have dismissed Bismarck,
you have made yourself into the tin god of a great monarchy, you have
shouted, reviewed, toasted, speechified, you have donned a thousand
different uniforms, you have dabbled in the drama, you have been
assisted in the design of allegorical cartoons, you have composed
hymns to Ægir, and Heaven knows how many others&mdash;and to-day the
result of all your restless and misdirected energies is that you have
added not only to your army but also to the foreign ill-wishers of
your country and to her internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> distractions. And at this moment,
in spite of the millions of men and money that go to form her army,
Germany is weaker than she has been at any moment since the Empire was
proclaimed at Versailles. This feat, Sir, you have accomplished, and
such credit as attaches to it is yours alone. Where and how do you
propose to end?</p></blockquote>

<p>In lighter vein but with equal disrespect <em>Punch</em> satirizes the
instructions to Prince Henry on starting with the naval expedition to
Kiao-Chow. In particular <em>Punch</em> dwells, not unfairly, on the Kaiser's
insistence on the sanctity of his mission. It was to be a Holy war:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">To preach abroad in each distinct locality</p>
<p class="i0">The gospel of my hallowed personality.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another was added to the long list of Indian Frontier wars in the
Tirah campaign. <em>Punch</em> did well to recognize the loyalty of native
officers, N.C.O.s and men, while saluting the achievements of the
Gordon Highlanders in his verses to their Commander, Colonel Mathias.
The men were "doing splendidly," but as Colonel <em>Punch</em> says in one
cartoon, "Yes, they always do; but is this 'forward policy' worth all
this?" And a similar misgiving is revealed in an article implying that
so-called "peaceful missions" to barbarian kings were too often closely
followed up by punitive expeditions. The "repercussions" of the Jameson
Raid were not overlooked. <em>Punch</em> made merry over President Krüger's
famous claim for "moral and intellectual damages"; but his criticisms
are not confined to the Boers. The proceedings of the South African
Committee of Inquiry prompted a parallel between Warren Hastings
and Cecil Rhodes, in which the Indian proconsul remarks to the new
Empire-builder: "<em>I</em> succeeded and was impeached; you fail&mdash;and are
called as a witness."</p>

<p>Of the second or Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, the last great
State pageant of her reign, one may say that it was more than a great
act of veneration and loyalty; it was a celebration of Imperial
expansion and solidarity which formed a reassuring interlude on the eve
of events that were destined to test that solidarity to the utmost. For
1898 was the year of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> Fashoda, of the conflict over the "open door" in
China, and of the Spanish-American war. I put Fashoda first, because
the incident came perilously near embroiling us in war with France.
It was not an isolated expression of French resentment, since the
general attitude of British public opinion over the Dreyfus affair had
greatly inflamed Anglophobia in France. <em>Punch</em>, like the majority of
Englishmen, was strongly Dreyfusard. Early in the year he published his
cartoon, based on Holman Hunt's picture, in which Zola figures as the
"Dreyfus Scapegoat"&mdash;a reference to the famous "J'accuse" article&mdash;and
a similar spirit is shown in the "Dreyfus Dictionary," in which strong
hostility is shown to all the leading actors on the anti-Dreyfus side.
On a large and sincerely patriotic section of the French public,
exasperated by what they considered to be a gratuitous interference in
a domestic affair, <em>Punch's</em> comments on the occupation of Fashoda in
the Sudan by Colonel Marchand operated like vitriol on a raw wound.
They certainly were not flattering to one, who if not a very discreet
was a very gallant soldier. Beginning with a farcical burlesque of the
stealthy invasion of the French, they go on from ridicule to contempt.
"Marchez, Marchand," says John Bull to the Colonel, ironically
congratulating him on having had a "nice little scientific trip." The
last straw was the cartoon in which John Bull says: "Go away, go away,"
to a French organ-grinder with a little monkey in uniform perched on
his instrument, which is labelled Fashoda. The organ-grinder says,
"Eh? What you give me if I go?" and John Bull retorts: "I'll give
you something if you <em>don't</em>." A "furious Gaul" broke <em>Mr. Punch's</em>
windows, and now we can understand and forgive the retaliation. It may
have been an added sting to say, as <em>Punch</em> did on the best authority,
that Colonel Marchand had been really saved from the Dervishes by
Kitchener's success at Omdurman. Anyhow, it was fortunate that Lord
Kitchener, who had served with the French in 1870 in Chanzy's army, was
in charge of the negotiations with Colonel Marchand on the spot. The
French Government did not give way until six weeks had passed, during
which Irish members had avowed their sympathy with France, and <em>Punch</em>
addressed her with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> serious warnings and even bellicose threats.
For the peaceful adjustment of what looked like a <em>casus belli</em>, we
certainly owe more to Lord Kitchener than to <em>Punch</em>. The battle of
Omdurman, fought on September 2, 1898, was the culminating point of
a carefully planned campaign which had lasted more than two years,
and was duly celebrated in <em>Punch's</em> cartoon of the re-occupation of
Khartum, with the statue of Gordon, avenged after thirteen years, in
the background. Lord Kitchener lost no time in issuing his appeal for
funds to erect the Gordon Memorial College in Khartum, to which <em>Punch</em>
dedicated his cartoon of "Dreaming True." The agreement delimiting the
respective spheres of England and France in North Africa was not signed
till January 19, 1899, but Punch had foreshadowed the issue in his
cartoon of John Bull as a "Fixture" in Egypt, his features replacing
the battered countenance of the Sphinx.</p>

<p class="center">"FOR QUEEN AND EMPIRE!!"</p>
</div>

<p>It cannot be said that <em>Punch</em> was any more conciliatory to the United
States over the Spanish-American war than he had been to France over
Fashoda. He is sympathetic to the young King of Spain, shown as a
small boy on the throne threatened by Bellona and Revolution. Both in
prose and verse he is distinctly hostile to the U.S.A., ironically
crediting them with no desire to annex Cuba, but talking almost in the
same breath of "filibustering" and "spread-eagling." And when Cuba was
acquired <em>Punch</em> professes to regard it as anything but an unmixed
blessing. Spain is shown saying to Uncle Sam: "Well, you wanted him!
You've got him! And I wish you joy of him!"&mdash;Cuba being represented as
an ill-conditioned little coloured boy. <em>Punch's</em> reading of the Treaty
of Peace was that Uncle Sam would agree to anything if Spain would take
Cuba back; while in another cartoon European resentment of American
intrusion into European politics is typified by a very "sniffy" Europa
asking Uncle Sam if he is "any relation of the late Colonel Monroe."
All this did not make for good blood, or the promotion of that friendly
understanding applauded in <em>Punch's</em> letter to Mr. Howells, but it
may be pleaded in extenuation that some of the sanest and wisest and
noblest Americans were not at all happy about the Spanish war, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
that Charles Eliot Norton openly denounced the mixture of hypocrisy and
thoughtlessness with which his countrymen had plunged into it.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The "Open Door" in China</em></div>

<p>The conflicting commercial interests of various Powers in China are
also the subject of a good deal of frank comment at the expense of
Russia and Germany. In one cartoon the British Lion is shown with a
barrow-load of goods denied entrance by the Bear at the "free port" of
Talienwan. In another, the "Open Door" is reduced to a farce, being
occupied by the Bear armed to the teeth and a German entrenched in
tariffs. A third, entitled "The Sentinels," is based on the view that
the occupation of Port Arthur left us no alternative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> but to occupy
Wei-hai-wei in order to restore the equilibrium upset by Russia. The
powerlessness of the young Emperor, who had proposed a scheme of
reforms, is clearly indicated in the dialogue in which the "Son of
Heaven" discusses his Aunt&mdash;the formidable Dowager-Empress. <em>Punch</em> had
a friendly greeting for the young Queen of Holland on the attainment of
her majority, referring to the House of Orange as a link with our Royal
family; but for the most part wherever he saw a crowned head he hit
it. The <em>lèse-majesté</em> campaign in Germany had led to the prosecution
of Herr Trojan, the editor of the <em>Kladderadatsch</em>, to whom <em>Punch</em>
offered his "Prosit," regretting that there was not also the companion
offence of <em>Humanitätsbeleidigung</em> for which punishment could be
awarded to "the Imperial buffoon." This was the year in which the young
Tsar Nicholas put forward his proposal for general disarmament, but
<em>Punch's</em> comments are very much on the lines of his satirical report
of an imaginary meeting of the Nations summoned by the Arbitration
League in 1894. Everybody was anxious to disarm so long as somebody
else set the example. This scepticism now finds vent in the cartoon
in which Peace suggests disarmament to Vulcan, understanding that the
Tsar's proposal had already seriously interfered with his trade. Vulcan
promptly undeceives her. He never was busier&mdash;and on orders for Russia.</p>

<p>The assassination of the Empress of Austria in September passed without
mention in <em>Punch</em>, an omission probably accidental rather than
deliberate, since she was popular in England as a great sportswoman.
She was also a generous and enlightened patron of the arts,
unconventional in her ways, blameless in her life, yet doomed by malign
fate to the supreme infelicity of grandeur.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Gladstone and "C.-B."</em></div>

<p><em>Punch</em> certainly missed a great opportunity for a chivalrous tribute
to a lady whose unhappiness was greater than her rank, to say nothing
of a text for a sermon on the notorious ineptitude of assassins in
the choice of victims. Still, it was a harder theme than that which
inspired <em>Punch's</em> most notable memorial verses in 1898&mdash;the death of
Mr. Gladstone. The writer contrasts his end with that of those who
have died in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> their early prime or the ripeness of their manhood, and

<p>A new leader of the Liberal Party emerged in 1899 in Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman. Sir William Harcourt is shown wishing his successor
joy&mdash;rather ironically&mdash;and Mr. Balfour, in the cartoon of "The
Wrestlers," acknowledges the strength of his opponent after their
first round. "C.-B.'s"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> promotion to leadership coincided with the
discussion of the Tsar's disarmament proposals, which the Liberal
leader was destined to revive later on, and in May, representatives
of Great Britain attended the Hague Conference convened on the Tsar's
initiative. The enthusiasm which <em>Punch</em> had displayed a generation
earlier over the Paris Conference had now evaporated, and his
contributions to the subject are marked by farcical scepticism. The
Tsar and the Kaiser are shown in one picture holding, at some uncertain
date in the future, an imaginary review of what remains of the Russian
Army, the soldiers resembling Stigginses armed with umbrellas.
<em>Punch's</em> twelve suggestions are a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of the Tsar's
idea, the first being a proposal to postpone the coming into operation
of the new rules for 1,000 years. The list of "Some Probable Agenda"
for the Hague Conference, published when it was already sitting, is
pure burlesque. For example: "Declarations of war shall in future be
abolished as being calculated to wound the feelings of opponents." In
the same number there is a large picture of Imperial Bruin drinking
to Peace, coupling the toast with the name of Victoria, Empress of
India (the Queen had just celebrated her eightieth birthday), with a
batch of papers, labelled "Further demands in China," behind his back.
The political atmosphere was not conducive to the calm discussion of
international peace. <em>Punch's</em> espousal of the cause of Dreyfus became
increasingly vehement and provocative. In May, under the heading "<em>A
bas la Vérité</em>," Truth is shown saying "I must get out" (of her well),
while the French generals reply: "Not if we know it." A month later, in
"At Last," Tenniel depicts indignant Justice triumphing with the Sword
of Revision, and trampling Lies and Forgery under foot. The universal
preoccupation with the topic is illustrated in Phil May's picture
of the little street boy crying because his father "has got Drifus
fever." In September, Napoleon's shade is shown scornfully surveying
a group of degenerate generals eagerly discussing a "secret dossier",
and saying, "<em>Vive l'armée!</em> Yes! But it was not with generals like
you that I won my campaigns!" In the face of death <em>Punch</em> has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> always
shown restraint, and, whether from ignorance or of set purpose, wrote
of President Faure:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

<p class="i0">And dying died with harness on.</p>

<p>But the address to France "in memory of the verdict of Rennes" amounts
to an indictment of the whole nation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w32"><div class="stanza">

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Verdict of Rennes</em></div>

<p><em>Punch</em>, it is true, spoke with a different voice on the same page, but
it is doubtful whether his levity was calculated to heal the effect of
his self-righteous indignation:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">SOME FURTHER SELF-DENYING ORDINANCES</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To be observed by those who wish to testify their righteous
indignation at the Rennes verdict by boycotting next year's Paris
Exposition, and in the most material and convincing manner to bring
about the complete rehabilitation of the unfortunate prisoner.</p>

<p>It is proposed&mdash;</p>

<p>That no more French leave shall be taken by individuals desirous of
absenting themselves from their duties or annexing other persons'
property. Undergraduates will faithfully attend every lecture,
city clerks will bury no more aunts, cooks will cease to entertain
policemen, and there will be a close time for burglary, kleptomania
and kissing under the mistletoe.</p>

<p>That the use of French chalk shall be abandoned in ballrooms, and
dancing given up altogether, except on village greens.</p>

<p>That "Frenchmen," alias red-legged partridges, shall be shot on sight,
and given to the retriever to eat.</p>

<p>That elbow-grease shall be substituted for French polish.</p>

<p>That French beans shall be cut and given the cold shoulder at table.</p>

<p>That the French language (which at the present moment chiefly consists
of the verb <em>conspuer</em>) shall be tabooed, except in the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> of
solecisms like <em>nom de plume</em>, <em>double entendre</em>, <em>à l'outrance</em>,
and so forth. <em>Café</em>, <em>coupé</em> and similar words shall be pronounced
"caif," "coop," etc., as in Canada. <em>Dépôt</em> shall be "depott";
<em>sang froid</em>, <em>au revoir</em>, <em>tableaux vivants</em> and the like shall be
similarly anglicized. Boulogne to be called "Boolong," if mentioned at
all, which is inadvisable. No more bull-fights to be attended.</p>

<p>That French grey shall in future mean, as circumstances demand, either
black or white.</p></blockquote>

<p>Towards America <em>Punch</em> shows a tempered benevolence in his open letter
to President McKinley, whom he warns against the new-fangled policy of
Imperial expansion. His welcome to Mr. Choate, on his appointment as
American Ambassador, is entirely cordial: "There are only two things
necessary to make your visit a success. Don't believe all you hear, and
read your <em>Punch</em> regularly." I do not know whether Mr. Choate took the
second piece of advice or not; the first was quite unnecessary. He was
a huge success as an Ambassador, though his chief claim on the abiding
affection of England rests on his noble and self-sacrificing exertions,
in extreme old age and up to the day of his death, in furthering the
cause of the Allies and strengthening the brotherhood in arms of
America and Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Lord Milner Censured</em></div>

<p>Meanwhile events in South Africa were rapidly approaching a critical
stage. At Mr. Chamberlain's request, a conference between Sir Alfred
Milner and President Krüger was held at Bloemfontein early in June
to adjust the conflicting claims of the Transvaal Boers and the
Uitlanders, whose position Sir Alfred Milner had compared to that of
"helots." <em>Punch</em> summed up the conference in two cartoons. In the
first, headed "Moral Suasion," Milner is seen endeavouring to pacify
Krüger as a cow: "I will sit on the stile and continue to smile." In
the second, "The Smile that Failed," the High Commissioner remarks:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Boer War</em></div>

<p>A very different reading of the situation is given in the letter to
Sir Alfred Milner published a week later. Here the High Commissioner
is heavily censured not for the failure of the conference, but for the
"ridiculous" and "frothy" tone of his dispatch about "helots," and for
his rash, impetuous and overbearing temper. In July <em>Punch</em> was still
inclined to make light of the whole business, apparently expecting
an amicable settlement, and in a burlesque "Story of a Crisis" in
"Nabothsland" reflected adversely if obliquely on the pretensions of
the Uitlanders. Yet early in September sympathy with the Uitlanders
underlies the verses condemning the inconsistency of Little Englanders,
who in theory espouse the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> cause of all oppressed nationalities but
their own. The damning blot on the Uitlanders' cause was that they were
English. If they had been Finns, for instance, the Little Englander
would have shed his last drop of ink in their defence. This was at
the lowest a good debating point, and at all points preferable to the
unfortunate picture ridiculing the unmilitary appearance of the Boers,
President Krüger being shown in the act of reviewing his veterans, a
number of fat, unwieldy farmers. The declaration of war came early
in October, and <em>Punch</em> unhesitatingly declared his support of the
decision in the cartoon "Plain English," where John Bull says to the
Boers: "As you will fight, you shall have it. This time it is a fight
to a finish." So it was; but few, except Lord Wolseley, expected that
the finish would only be reached after a long, obstinate and costly
struggle. Lord Wolseley's warning in September, 1899, foreshadows the
more famous anticipation of the duration of the Great War made by Lord
Kitchener fifteen years later. Many other parallels and contrasts
are suggested in <em>Punch's</em> pages as he reflects the varying moods of
England during the chequered progress of the campaign. The divisions of
opinion at home were more acute than in 1914. Moreover, we entered on
the Boer war in a spirit of confidence and complacency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
which rendered the initial reverses more surprising and depressing.
Otherwise the alternations of despondency and elation; the criticisms
of mismanagement, laxity and indifference, want of intelligence and
imagination; and the charges against the enemy of disregarding the
rules of the game have a curiously familiar ring. <em>Punch</em> reflected
popular opinion in resenting the "detachment" of Mr. Balfour in
describing our reverses as "inevitable," and in rebuking the optimism
of other Ministers; in his demand for the "facts"; in attributing to
President Krüger gratitude to the Opposition for their assistance;
in his cheering message to Baden-Powell for "keeping his end up" in
Mafeking. Yet he commented severely on the diamond speculators for
their "operations" during the war; he had a good word for Lord Morley
when he was attacked as a Little Englander; and a strong rebuke for the
agencies which announced tours to the South African battlefields as
early as April, 1900. Punch had shown John Bull as Mark Tapley&mdash;when
Kimberley had been relieved and Lord Roberts was advancing&mdash;but his
comments on the publication of the Spion Kop dispatches reveal grave
dissatisfaction with the conduct of the Natal campaign:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">SOME ONE HAD BLUNDERED</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w34"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Sir Redvers devised an impossible plan</p>
<p class="i0">Which he trusted to Warren, an obstinate man;</p>
<p class="i0">Lord Roberts sent home some dispatches, and there</p>

<p class="i0">The War Office published these documents plain,</p>
<p class="i0">To the joy of their foes, and the grief of the sane;</p>
<p class="i0">And while they were reading them, all the world wondered,</p>
<p class="i0">And promptly concluded that everyone blundered.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Humorous relief was provided by the report that Krüger had encouraged
his burghers by circulating the news that London had been captured by
the Russians, a method foreshadowing the imaginative exploits of the
Germans in the late war. It was based, however, on an incontestable
fact&mdash;our unpopularity in both hemispheres. The Boer delegates had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
been welcomed in America, though <em>Punch</em> sought to discount the effect
of their propaganda by a cartoon in which Columbia reassures John Bull:
"Don't mind those noisy boys of mine. You know, my dear, it's <em>Election
Time</em>."</p>

<p>The Anglophobe feeling was much more vocal in France, and <em>Punch</em> gives
a curious account of the Transvaal section of the Paris Exhibition in
October, where signatures were invited and freely appended to addresses
to the two Presidents, the bust of Krüger was crowned with palm
branches, poetic eulogies were circulated, and the walls covered with
"<em>Mort aux Anglais</em>," "Chamberlain <em>est un vache</em>," etc. Meanwhile,
Mafeking had been relieved, and <em>Punch</em> had defended the "loud extremes
of passionate joy" which added the now well-nigh forgotten verb "to
Maffick" to our current vocabulary. Lord Roberts's uninterrupted
advance to Pretoria had moved <em>Punch</em>, with many others, to declare
very prematurely on June 6th that the war was practically over, though
it lasted nearly two years longer, and the slow progress of "rounding
up" the Boers actually prompted the suggestion from a leading paper
that Lord Kitchener should be recalled and Lord Roberts sent out again.
President Krüger's flitting is illustrated in a cartoon in which "Oom
Paul" is seen in a small boat, with two millions of treasure, quitting
the sinking ship <em>Transvaal</em>; while in a set of verses, written after
reading of his triumphal progress through France, <em>Punch</em> prophesies
for him a green old age in Grosvenor Square. The C.I.V.'s returned
in the autumn and were welcomed by the City of London; and shortly
afterwards "a Mr. Williams offered respectful apologies to Satan for
mentioning him in the same breath with Lord Kitchener." <em>Punch</em>, even
in his most Chauvinistic mood, never indulged in such abuse of the Boer
generals, and at the end of 1900 paid a well-deserved compliment to the
elusive De Wet in his cartoon of "De Wet o' de Wisp."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>China and Australia</em></div>

<p>Before dealing with the subsequent progress of the "guerrilla war,"
we may turn aside for a moment to other developments overseas. In an
epigram on "The Millennium" in August, 1900, <em>Punch</em> writes:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">In some problematic day</p>
<p class="i0">Strife and wrath shall fade away,</p>
<p class="i0">Crews no longer blessing pouring</p>
<p class="i2">On the coxes who have cox'd,</p>
<p class="i0">When the Boers shall cease from boring</p>
<p class="i2">And the Boxers shall be boxed.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The revolt of the Boxers in China and the joint expedition of the
European Powers assisted by Japan to relieve the Legations in Peking
are treated in two cartoons. In the first, in which the Chinese Dragon
is seen in the background, Japan expresses her readiness to help the
European Powers. She is glad to join them, "but permit me to remark
that if some of you hadn't interfered when I had him down, it would
have saved all this trouble"&mdash;a legitimate comment on the intervention
of Germany and Russia after the Chino-Japanese war. In the second, "The
Closed Door," Europa is seen armed with an axe, preparing to break her
way in to the relief of the Legations. Apocryphal reports of what was
happening in China reached a high-water mark of mendacity this summer,
and the English Press did not escape the charge of credulity, to put
it mildly. Reports of the death of the Dowager Empress were so common
as to inspire <em>Punch</em> with a poetic homage to the "lady of the charmed
life," and when she shifted her capital, he showed Krüger looking over
a wall at her exodus with the remark: "My idea!"</p>

<p>It was in 1900 also that the Australian Commonwealth Bill was
introduced by Mr. Chamberlain. <em>Punch</em> in his first reference to the
measure, animated by a recognition of Australia's loyalty in the
Boer war, assumed that Clause 74, abolishing the appeal to the Privy
Council, would be passed. Australia is seen showing the new latchkey
she has had made, as she wanted a little more freedom, and Britannia
declares her readiness to trust her. This proved premature, and a
little later on <em>Punch</em>, in a letter to the Australian delegates, waxes
sarcastic over the "niggling, pedantic and pettifogging inquisition
which it was proposed to institute into the demand for Federation"&mdash;<em>à
propos</em> of the Privy Council Appeals. As a matter of fact, the clause
was amended, because the States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> were not at one on the point, and all
seven Chief Justices favoured the maintenance of the right of Appeal.</p>

<p>Lord Roberts returned to England at the close of the year, and <em>Punch</em>
saluted his arrival in "The Home-coming of the Chief." His great
services are acknowledged, not least his self-sacrifice in the hour of
bitter personal loss:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"REQUIESCAT!"</p>
</div>

<p>That is truly and finely said, and yet how strangely the epithet
"dreadful" sounds to those who have found all the vocabulary of horror
beggared by the experiences of the Great War! The opening of the New
Year was clouded by the passing of Queen Victoria. In all the sixty
years of <em>Punch's</em> existence, even in the moods when his comments on
Court and Crown had been frank to the verge of audacity, loyalty to the
person of the Sovereign had never failed. His adverse criticism was
seldom malicious, and was almost always animated by a desire that the
Sovereign should never fall below the standard of <em>noblesse oblige</em>.
The days of resentment against the Queen's prolonged seclusion had long
passed. She had ceased to be "the Royal Recluse," and was unsparing of
herself in the discharge of her duties up to within a few weeks of her
death. When she spoke in one of her messages of "her beloved people,"
there could be no question of her sincerity, or of the devotion with
which her love was returned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>As Mr. Balfour said significantly of her: "Even those who loved not
England loved her," and in later years those who came to scoff at her
memory remained to praise:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Candid Friends and Hostile Critics</em></div>

<p>The "Khaki" election of the previous autumn, at which the Government
had appealed to the country to decide the issue of fighting the war to
a finish, had resulted in the return of the Unionists by a majority of
134, but did not abate the activities of the "Stop the War" party. They
were stimulated to further and more vehement protests by the policy of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> Concentration Camps, and the loss of life through epidemics caused
by the compulsory herding together of those who were interned. Between
the denunciations of British "brutalities" by the German Press and the
talk of "hecatombs of slaughtered babes" by British Liberals&mdash;between
"candid friends" and hostile critics&mdash;there was not much to choose.
<em>Punch</em> invoked the shade of Bismarck to rebuke the excesses of the
German journalists; he ridiculed Miss Emily Hobhouse's descriptions of
Concentration Camp horrors by giving a list of the luxuries which were
not provided there&mdash;hairpins, curling-tongs, etc.&mdash;and in a cartoon at
the close of the year represented the "Stop the War" group as making
such a noise that Peace's voice could not be heard. Cleavage was shown
in the ranks of the Opposition, and <em>Punch</em> did not fail to emphasize
the divergences between Mr. Asquith and the Imperialist Liberals on the
one side, and "C.-B." and Sir William Harcourt on the other. General
Baden-Powell arrived in England in July, and <em>Punch's</em> greeting aptly
describes his mood and that of the man in the street:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w36"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Time has flown; but not forgotten is the tale of Mafeking!</p>
<p class="i2">Who that lived that Day in London could forget its echoing ring?</p>

<p class="i2">How each man for joy saluted every other man as friend!</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">How we crowded to the city in an orgy of delight,</p>
<p class="i2">Tumbled out of bed for gladness, waving Union Jacks all night!</p>

<p class="i2">Though we later coined a playful word, our soberer sense to show,</p>
<p class="i2">I would rather "maffick" daily than abet a treacherous foe!</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the controversies that arose over the treatment of various British
generals, I may note that <em>Punch</em> supported the motion for an inquiry
into the circumstances under which General Colvile was deprived of his
command, which was negatived in the House by 262 votes to 248. Over
the still more thorny question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> of General Buller's conduct of the
Natal campaign he preserved an impartial attitude, while implying that
the general would not exploit his grievance for political purposes.
Early in the war <em>Punch</em> paid a rather left-handed compliment to the
war correspondents; they are represented as welcoming war because it
brought them remunerative employment. In the autumn of 1901 we find him
pressing their claims for war medals, and observing that the Press had
been shut out but not shut up.</p>

<p>The war, he also notes on the authority of a daily paper, had produced
more poets than any similar crisis in English history. A more striking
parallel with recent war-products is to be found in <em>Punch's</em> review
of the depression, discontent and decline of trade which it had begun
to cause before hostilities ceased. This is clearly shown in July,
1901, in the Preface to Vol. cxxi, where <em>Punch</em> rebukes John Bull,
no longer in his Mark Tapley vein, for listening to pessimists, and
encouraging a seditious and pernicious Press. In the opening stages
of the war <em>Punch</em> had been none too friendly to Lord Methuen, but he
was righteously indignant at the "Ghoul-like ecstasy" of the Irish
Members who cheered the news of the defeat and capture of that gallant
soldier in the spring of 1902. The end of the war came in June, and is
chronicled in <em>Punch's</em> "Cease Fire" cartoon. The happiest incident
of the surrender was the speech made by Lord Kitchener to the Boer
delegates at Vereeniging when he said that "if he had been one of them,
he would have been proud to have done so well in the field as they had
done." <em>Punch</em> did well to record it, for it reflected the national
respect felt for a stubborn foe. For confirmation we need only turn
to the laconic entry in the <em>National Register</em> for August 16, 1902:
"The Boer generals, Botha, De Wet and Delarey ... proceeded to London,
and had an enthusiastic popular reception." Subsequent events have
justified the somewhat complacent remark attributed to John Bull in the
cartoon two months later, <em>à propos</em> of the grant of £3,000,000 to the
Transvaal, and the Boers' "Appeal to the Civilized World": "Look here,
my friend, stick that up, if you like; but I think you'll find that <em>I</em>
talk less than the others and give more."</p>

<p>Mr. Roosevelt had succeeded to the Presidency of the United States on
the assassination of Mr. McKinley, and <em>Punch</em>, after condoling with
Columbia, saluted the "Rough-Rider."</p>

<p>Our closer relations with Japan and their effect on Russia are
symbolized in the cartoon in which she remarks as a <em>tertia</em> anything
but <em>gaudens</em>: "H'm&mdash;I don't like these confidences." In Europe the
subject that provoked <em>Punch's</em> closest attention was the treatment
of the Poles by Germany. There is an amusing story in "Charivaria,"
probably apocryphal, but not beyond the possibilities of Prussian
pedantry:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Fifty Prussian schoolgirls have been arrested at Gnesen on a charge of
high treason, and the police are said to have their eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> on several
Kindergartens, where it is reported that the children have been
playing "I'm the king of the Castle" and other games suggestive of
Majestätsbeleidigung.</p></blockquote>

<p>But the whole essence of "Prussification" is summed up in the last
quatrain of a brilliant adaptation of the "Pied Piper of Hamelin" to
the situation in Posen:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

<p>Lord Salisbury had resigned in the summer of 1902, and Mr. Balfour had
succeeded to the Premiership. It was not exactly a case of "Amurath
to Amurath," but with nephew succeeding to uncle, and the presence of
another nephew and a son-in-law in the Cabinet, there was some ground
for the once familiar gibes against the "Hotel Cecil." <em>Punch</em> was
not unfriendly to the new Premier, and applauded his handling of the
negotiations initiated by Germany to secure a British subsidy to the
German-controlled Baghdad railway. In "The Trap that Failed," the
British Lion "doesn't like the look of it and resolves to go round the
other way"; and the verses (after Omar Khayyám) indicate the surprise
of "the Potter of Potsdam" at the unexpected firmness of Mr. Balfour.
The gradual improvement of our relations with other foreign Powers is
symbolized in "The Chain of Friendship," showing King Edward joining
in a dance with France, Italy and Portugal; while the strengthening
of the Anglo-French <em>Entente</em> is illustrated in the cartoon in which
King Edward, presenting the British Lion, says to the French President:
"See, M. Loubet, he offers you his paw." An element of reserve,
however, is shown in a dialogue in French, mildly satirizing the new
Anglomania; and in the burlesque sketch foreshadowing the ludicrous
and disastrous influence on both countries of the <em>Entente</em>&mdash;e.g. the
re-introduction of the duel on the initiative of the <em>Daily Mail</em>; the
presentation of Waterloo Station to the French and, as a set-off, the
presentation of the Keys of Calais to the Lord Mayor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> London by the
Paris Municipal Council. To turn from gay to grave, this was the year
of the assassination of the King and Queen of Serbia, recorded in the
cartoon of "Murder as the King Maker."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Ireland, Army Reform, and India</em></div>

<p>Home politics fill a larger space in 1903 in <em>Punch's</em> pages than
for some years previously. Remedial legislation in Ireland inspires
the cartoon of Mr. Balfour as St. Patrick&mdash;a saint invaluable to the
harassed cartoonist&mdash;driving out the snakes of sedition. The basis
of Mr. Wyndham's Land Purchase Act is well shown in the cartoon
illustrating the financial relations of the two countries. Tenant and
landlord both present money-boxes labelled "Land Purchase" to John
Bull, asking him to "put a thrifle in them"; John Bull scratches his
head, but he pays all the same. The difficulties of Mr. Brodrick in
securing national support for Army Reform are set forth in the verses
on "The Unhappy Warrior" (after Wordsworth), and the cartoon "Ready,
aye unready," with John Bull asleep on sentry duty&mdash;<em>à propos</em> of the
Report of the Royal Commission on the South African war. A little
later, John Bull's short memory is satirized in his protest against
the size of his new watch-dog. Forgetting that he had clamoured for
increase, he now declares that he cannot afford him.</p>

<p>At the opening of the year <em>Punch</em> had lavishly chronicled the glories
of the Delhi Durbar. "The Pilgrims to the East" included three members
of his staff, who did justice to the occasion both with pen and pencil,
and Sambourne's fine cartoon, "<em>Vivat Imperator</em>," forms an instructive
pendant and palinode to <em>Punch's</em> anti-imperialist misgivings of 1876,
when he regarded the assumption of the new title as a piece of shoddy
Disraelian Orientalism.</p>

<p>Lord Salisbury's death in 1903 removed a great figure, whose prestige
has grown with the knowledge available in later years. We have learned
to revise the old view of his political stature as compared with
that of Lord Beaconsfield, and to reject the often-quoted but quite
erroneous saying attributed to Bismarck that he was "a lath painted
to resemble iron." <em>Punch's</em> memorial tribute admits that he "nothing
common did or mean":&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>When Lord Salisbury, resigning the Premiership, practically retired
from public life, a gap was made in the House of Lords no living
man might fill. Only once has he returned to the scene of memorable
labour. He came with the rest of the cloaked Peers to pay homage to
King Edward the Seventh when first he seated himself on the throne
which he had long regarded from the point of view of the Cross
Benches. There was hope that the ex-Premier would, from time to time,
still give the House and the country the advantage of his sagacious
counsel, the pleasure of listening to his brilliant speech. But, like
the other tall man in another chair, "his heart was worn with work."
He was sick of the sometimes mean rivalry of political life, and felt
he had earned his leisure.</p>

<p>In a manner unique Lord Salisbury had the faculty of standing apart
from his fellow men, regarding them and appraising them as if he
himself did not belong to the <em>genus</em>. It was as if a man from Mars
had visited our planet, studying its pygmy population with amused,
on the whole scornful interest. With one exception he was the only
statesman who never bent the knee to the Baal known in political
chatter as The Man in the Street. The exception is, of course, the
Duke of Devonshire, who had further kinship with the Marquis in
respect of absolute freedom from desire to get anything for himself
out of the game of politics. Intellectually and morally&mdash;this
latter more precious because more rare&mdash;Lord Salisbury uplifted and
maintained at high level the standard of English public life. He was
a man whom foreigners, equally with his own countrymen, unreservedly
trusted, because of a personal quality worth the whole armoury of
diplomacy.</p>

<p>With his withdrawal from the stage, the House of Lords as a debating
assembly lost its chief attraction. It was worth sitting through a
dreary couple of hours for the chance reward of hearing him speak.
Whilst others discoursed he sat impassive, taking no note, making no
sign of hearing, or caring about, what the noble lord on his legs said
or left unspoken. Only a curious rapid movement of the crossed leg
betokened cogitation, betrayed closest attention, and the framing of
some sentences that would presently play about the adversary's head
like forked lightning.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Fiscal Fray</em></div>

<p>An event of greater immediate interest which coincided with the passing
of Lord Salisbury was the resignation of Mr. Chamberlain. On his return
from a strenuous and exhausting tour in South Africa, he had thrown
himself with immense energy into the Tariff Reform campaign, and
withdrew from the Cabinet in order to devote his entire energies to the
prosecution of the cause. <em>Punch's</em> pages throughout the second half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of 1903 furnish a lively chronicle of the progress of Mr. Chamberlain's
crusade and the wonderful egg-dance of Mr. Balfour. Early in September
the situation is portrayed in "The Parting of the Ways." Mr. Balfour,
"long troubled by philosophic doubt," is shown on the road with a
knapsack labelled "Treasury Returns" and "Board of Trade Returns,"
looking at a sign-post, one arm pointing to Chatsworth, the other to
Highbury, and saying: "Well, now, I suppose I must really make up my
mind."</p>

<p>A week later we have the Fiscal Hamlet in "The Unready Reckoner."
Prince Arthur remarks: "O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers; I
have not the art to reckon," while on the wall hangs a portrait of Mr.
Chamberlain as Ophelia. In November, under the heading "An Eye for
Effect," <em>Punch</em> exhibits "Foreign Competition" as a Guy on a barrow,
with Mr. Chamberlain in charge and conversing with Mr. Balfour:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Arthur</span>: "Ain't you made 'im too 'orrible?"</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><span class="smcap">Joe</span>: "No fear! You <em>can't</em> make 'em too 'orrible!"</span><br />
</p>

<p>Simultaneously, <em>Punch</em> published a burlesque on the <em>Daily Mail's</em>
canvass, with expressions of opinion from Henry James, Rudyard Kipling
and Mr. A. B. Walkley. The <em>Daily Express</em>, not to be outdone, offered
a prize of £25 to the owner of the first parrot taught to speak
distinctly the phrase: "Your food will cost you more." The "folly of
the fray" was not overlooked, but <em>Punch</em> did not misread its essential
significance in his cartoon of Mr. Chamberlain in the guise of the
political Ancient Mariner who had slain the albatross of Conservative
unity.</p>

<p>Foreign politics once more dominated the scene in 1904, when the
legacy of friction, bequeathed by Russia's intervention at the close
of the Chino-Japanese war and her Manchurian policy after the "Boxer"
outbreak, bore its inevitable fruit in the Russo-Japanese war. The
sympathy of England with Japan is reflected in the pages of <em>Punch</em>.
He rebuked the hissing of Russian performers at a performance in the
provinces; but satirized the indignation generally expressed in Russia
that Japan should have begun hostilities without a formal declaration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
or, as <em>Punch</em> put it, without consulting Russia as to whether the date
was convenient to her. The fervent patriotism of the Japanese army is
cordially applauded: John Bull is shown in a mood of envy, thinking he
must try to introduce it at home. The unfortunate Dogger Bank incident,
when Admiral Rozhdestvensky's fleet, on their way out to the Far East,
fired on a fleet of British trawlers, aroused great indignation, mixed
with bitter satire of Russian nerves and thrasonical satisfaction.
<em>Punch</em> published a scarifying parody of Campbell's "Battle of the
Baltic" on this "famous victory" over a "hostile trawling fleet"
engaged in "gutting plaice." Later on in "Admirals All" there is an
equally sarcastic comment on the Report of the North Sea Court of
Inquiry, at which the Russians were exculpated by an Austrian Admiral.
Nor was <em>Punch's</em> indignation expressed against Russia alone. The
acceptance of Russian orders by British coal exporters is chastised in
a cartoon with the legend as under:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i2">Old King Coal</p>
<p class="i2">Was a sordid old soul,</p>

<p class="i2">And he didn't care a cuss,</p>
<p class="i0">And the Baltic fleet crossed the sea.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>On the fall of Port Arthur, however, <em>Punch</em> did not forget to
acknowledge the heroism of the defence: here, at least, "the honour
of the Russian eagle was untarnished." The war ended in May, 1905,
but before its close Russian internal unrest had become menacing and
hampered the prosecution of hostilities. <em>Punch</em> read the signs of the
times truly in his cartoon of Death as the Czar of all the Russias,
with a figure holding a "Petition" lying slain at his feet; and again
in his rather cruel verses to "The Little Father":&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">THE CZAR OF ALL THE RUSSIAS</p>
</div>

<p>The contrasted outlook in Russia and Japan is shown in "Peace and
After"&mdash;gloom and storm in the one country, general rejoicing in
the other. The signing of the Peace in October brought mutiny and
insurrection in Russia, repressed for the moment by grape-shot and
concessions. <em>Punch</em> distrusted the former method, and warned the Tsar
through the mouth of Louis XVI: "Side with the people, Sire, while
there is yet time. <em>I</em> was too late." The instalment of constitutional
government granted was shorn of its grace by the antecedent display
of ruthlessness. <em>Punch</em> typified this situation in his cartoon of
the Tsar armed with a sword and leaning on a cannon, with corpses
strewn around, and saying: "Now I think the way is clear for universal
suffrage." But <em>Punch</em> was premature in saluting the first Duma&mdash;opened
by the Tsar in person in May, 1906&mdash;as the Infant Hercules strangling
the twin snakes of Bureaucracy and Despotism. It was the Duma which was
strangled by these forces, of which the first was the more potent and
malign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Belgium and Germany</em></div>

<p>Another foreign monarch who came in for severe criticism in these
years was King Leopold II of the Belgians. Quite recently he had been
treated by <em>Punch</em> with a benevolence that bordered on fulsomeness. But
1904 was the year of the "Congo Atrocities," and <em>Punch</em>, in a cartoon
modelled on the ancient Egyptian lines, compared him with the Pharaoh
Rameses II whose scribes counted over the hands cut from his vanquished
enemies. This was suggested by the stories of the similar treatment of
the natives in the rubber plantations vouched for by the British Consul
at Boma. The value of this evidence has since been impaired by the fact
that the Consul in question was none other than Roger Casement. From
Belgium to Germany the transition is easy. In the last two years of
the Unionist administration, German aggressiveness is a constant theme
of comment, mainly inspired by misgiving, occasionally enlivened by
burlesque belittlement of scaremongers. To the latter category belongs
the forecast, at the close of 1904, of the invasion of London, seized
during a week-end exodus of its inhabitants. Nor should we fail to
note the series of appreciative articles on life in Berlin in 1905, in
which "Tom the Tourist" finds the German capital "one of the liveliest,
pleasantest and handsomest of cities," and descants on its good beer,
pleasant company, genial hospitality, and the absence of any sign of
hatred of the British. The writer even goes so far as to compare the
Sieges-Allée favourably with some of the statuary of London. But a
different note is struck in the lines on the vicarious patriotism of
those who objected to conscription; in the references to the inadequacy
of our coast defences; in the satisfaction expressed in the appointment
of Sir John Fisher as First Sea Lord, and the improvement in naval
gunnery; and in the satire directed against the new German Chancellor,
Count von Bülow, for his cynical "<em>blague</em>." As "<em>Der Taubadler</em>," he
reproves President Roosevelt for Jingoism, and declares:&mdash;</p>

<p>Lord Roberts's warning speech at the London Chamber of Commerce in the
late summer of 1902 had prompted the cartoon "The Call to Arms." John
Bull, aroused from slumber and only half-awake, asks "What's wrong?"
Lord Roberts, the warning warder, replies: "You are absolutely unfitted
and unprepared for war!" whereon John Bull rejoins drowsily: "Am I?
You <em>do</em> surprise me," and goes to bed again. Growing distrust of the
Kaiser is shown in the cartoon in which he figures as "The Sower of
Tares" after Millais's picture, while <em>Punch</em> simultaneously manifests
his satisfaction at the strengthening of the Anglo-French <em>Entente</em>.
The British working man, if <em>Punch</em> is to be believed, disliked all
foreigners, but his pet aversion was "them blooming Germans." There
was, at any rate, a legitimate grievance in the fact that fifty-nine
foreign pilots were employed on our coasts, whereas abroad our ships
were compelled to take native pilots; and the Nelson Centenary on
October 21, 1905, impelled <em>Punch</em>, in an address to the hero of
Trafalgar, to deplore the decay of national patriotism in a vein of
pessimism happily falsified ten years later:&mdash;</p>

<p>The "decline and fall" of the Unionist administration are symbolized
and explained in two cartoons in the late summer of 1905. In one Mr.
Balfour is seen, a lonely swimmer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> wallowing in the sea of Public
Opinion. A voice from the Tug (Tory Organization) hails him, urging him
to keep afloat and he'll "drift in to the shore" (Session 1906). He
replies that he "can't do much against a tide like this." The sources
of weakness are even better diagnosed in the cartoon of August 30,
"Shelved," showing the group of statesmen who had resigned&mdash;the Duke of
Devonshire, Mr. Ritchie, Lord Balfour of Burleigh, Lord George Hamilton
and Mr. George Wyndham.</p>

<p>The rout of the Government at the General Election of 1906 was a
veritable <em>débâcle</em>. Liberal candidates were returned who never got
in before or after: there is a story of one so overwhelmed by his
wholly unexpected success that he fainted on the declaration of the
poll. Ministers went down like ninepins, and on the meeting of the new
Parliament <em>Punch</em> descants on the disappearance of the "old familiar
faces"&mdash;Mr. Arthur Balfour and his brother Gerald, Alfred Lyttelton and
St. John Brodrick, Bonar Law, Sir John Gorst, Sir Albert Rollit, Sir W.
Hart Dyke, Gibson Bowles, and, "saddest fate of all and most lamented,"
Mr. Henry Chaplin. The emergence of a new, formidable, but uncertain
factor was at once recognized in the cartoon in which John Bull looks
over the wall at a bull labelled Labour Vote. The Trade Disputes Bill,
the first and most notable concession to the demands of Trade Unionism,
is discussed in the next section.</p>

</div>

<p><em>Punch</em> was more preoccupied with Lord Haldane's new army scheme,
and when the War Minister, in introducing it, declared that the
country would not be "dragooned into conscription," interpreted his
statement "in other and less conventional terms" as indicating a
conviction that "it is the inalienable right of the free-born British
citizen to decline to lift a finger in his country's defence." Lord
Haldane's proposals for retrenchment are symbolized in his efforts to
make big toy soldiers fit his box, instead of making the box fit the
soldiers. Wasters and loafers who had cheered "Bobs" on his return
from South Africa are shown expressing indignation at his wanting to
enforce universal military service. <em>Punch's</em> reluctant admission
of our national lethargy finds vent in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> dialogue emphasizing the
predominance of the <em>Panem et Circenses</em> spirit&mdash;devotion to the Big
Loaf and spectacular games&mdash;coupled with a loss of our supremacy in
games. The pageant mania became acute in 1907, when <em>Punch</em> satirically
asks, "Can you cite any other country where it is impossible to walk
out of doors without colliding with an historical pageant?"</p>

<p>Lord Haldane's visit to Germany in 1906 is burlesqued in a diary
professing to reveal his paramount interest in German philosophy and
literature; and a picture, in which he appears in a <em>Pickelhaube</em>,
expresses the misgivings of two British soldiers who had overheard
him "talking to himself in German&mdash;something horrible." This attitude
of critical distrust is maintained throughout the next four years. In
March, 1908, the new gun designed for the Territorial Force prompts a
dialogue between the War Minister and Field-Marshal <em>Punch</em>:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Haldane</span>: "In the event of invasion, I shall depend
upon my brave Territorial force to manipulate this magnificent and
complicated weapon."</p>

<p>F.-M. <em>Punch</em>: "Going to give them any training?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. H.</span>: "Oh, perhaps a fortnight or so a year."</p>

<p>F.-M. <em>Punch</em>: "Ah! Then they'll need to be pretty brave, won't they?"</p></blockquote>

<p>Further satire is expended in August of the same year on "A Skeleton
Army; or, The Charge of the Very Light Brigade":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Haldane</span> (at Cavalry Manoeuvres): "You see those three men?
Well, they're pretending to be one hundred. Isn't that imaginative?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr.</span> <em>Punch</em>: "Realistic, you mean. That's about what it will
come to with us in real warfare."</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Punch</em> was not happy about our Navy either, and in 1906 he had rallied
Lord Tweedmouth, then at the Admiralty, for reassuring Britannia
against the German menace. It was no use to say, "We don't take no
account of them things"; the monster was there, and could not be
belittled. By the end of the year, however, <em>Punch's</em> complacency
was restored by the advance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> in our naval gunnery, and Britannia is
seen proudly showing the impressive tabulated results of our big gun
practice. The Germans are the only modern people who have a single word
to express delight in the misfortunes of others&mdash;<em>Schadenfreude</em>. It
is not a noble sentiment, but a suspicion of it mingles with <em>Punch's</em>
comments on Germany's internal troubles. In 1878 he had shown Bismarck
squeezing down the Socialist Jack-in-the-Box, and nearly thirty years
later repeats the formula at the expense of Count von Bülow; but the
Socialist Jack-in-the-Box was now a much more formidable figure: it was
"a bigger task for a smaller man."</p>

<p>The twenty-fifth anniversary of the Triple Alliance fell in 1907, and
<em>Punch</em> indicated that Italy's allegiance was already wearing thin.
In performing the trio "We are a happy Family," Austria's "We are" is
marked <em>piano</em>, and that of Italy <em>dubioso</em>.</p>

<p>In the domain of high politics, Imperial and International, 1907 was
marked by two notable events. The grant of autonomy to the Transvaal
undoubtedly contained an element of risk, but the sequel showed
that magnanimity was the best policy. General Botha's Premiership
proved a symbol of reconciliation destined in time to bear "rare
and refreshing fruit," and <em>Punch</em> was fairly entitled to invoke
the reluctant testimony of Krüger's shade: "What! Botha <em>Premier</em>?
Well, these English <em>do</em> 'stagger humanity'!" Secondly, there was
the Hague Conference, over which <em>Punch</em> maintained his attitude of
scepticism, on the ground that each Power was unwilling to lead the
way in disarmament. In his cartoon of the various nations at the door
of the Conference everybody says, "After you, Sir," to everybody else.
The Government's extensive programme of legislation for the following
session is shown in the picture of "C.-B." at the piano accompanying
the Infant Prodigy, 1908. The programme includes the "Twilight of the
Lords," "<em>Etudes Pacifiques</em>"; "<em>Danse anti-Bacchanale</em>" and "Irish
Rhapsody" with Campobello, McKenna, Asquith and Birrell as soloists.
The campaign against the Lords, opened at Edinburgh by "C.-B." in
October, 1907, suggested the cartoon of the "Fiery Cross" with the
Premier as a kilted warrior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> shouting, "Doon wi' the Lords!" while
the accompanying verses, in the ballad manner of Scott, describe
the passing on of the fiery cross by Lord Crewe, John Morley, Mr.
Sinclair (now Lord Pentland), Lord Tweedmouth, Mr. Runciman, and "Lloyd
McGeorge."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Naval Misgivings</em></div>

<p>The mention of Lord Tweedmouth reminds one that the question of our
naval supremacy had entered on a new phase. As <em>Punch</em> put it in his
"Charivaria" in November, 1907, "There seems to be a difference of
opinion between the Prince of Wales and Sir John Fisher. Some little
time ago His Royal Highness, speaking at the Guildhall, cried: 'Wake
up, England!' Sir John, speaking in the same place, has now issued the
advice: 'Sleep quietly in your beds.'"</p>

<p>In the spring of 1908 occurred the awkward incident of the Kaiser's
letter to Lord Tweedmouth on Naval Retrenchment. <em>Punch</em>, in his
"Essence of Parliament," benevolently minimizes the First Lord's
indiscretion, which, along with other causes, led to his withdrawal
from the Admiralty; at the same time there appeared some highly
ironical reflections on the attitude of the advocates of the
Two-Power-Standard. In an ingenious adaptation of Tennyson's ballad of
"The Revenge," Sir Thomas Howard refuses to fight because he is one
ship short of the Two-Power-Standard.</p>

<p>In early Victorian days the Duke of Wellington was commonly alluded to
as "the Duke" <em>par excellence</em>. In the opening years of the present
century, in political circles at any rate, when people spoke of "the
Duke" they always meant the Duke of Devonshire, and for reasons which
are tersely and correctly given in <em>Punch's</em> brief memorial verses when
he died in March, 1908:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w30"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">If to have held his way with steadfast will,</p>
<p class="i2">Unspoiled of Fortune, deaf to praise or blame,</p>
<p class="i0">Asking no favour but to follow still</p>
<p class="i2">The patriot's single aim:&mdash;</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">If, in contempt of other pride of race,</p>
<p class="i2">By honesty that chose the nobler part,</p>
<p class="i0">Careless of fame's reward, to win a place</p>
<p class="i2">Near to the common heart:&mdash;</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">If these be virtues large, heroic, rare,</p>
<p class="i2">Then is it well with him, the dead, to-day,</p>
<p class="i0">Who leaves a public record clean and fair,</p>
<p class="i2">That Time shall not gainsay.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The tribute is one which, we think, would have appealed to the dead
statesman, a man of few words, but who in the words of another Duke,
the Duke of Argyll, was "firm as the rock, and clear as the crystal
that adorns the rock."</p>

<p>A few weeks later Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, broken in health,
resigned the Premiership, dying so soon afterwards that he virtually
died in harness. <em>Punch</em> did not overstate things in describing his
death as "a common grief" to Liberals and Unionists, for he had
outlived the obloquy of party bitterness and revealed as Premier
qualities which his successor, Mr. Asquith, fittingly described when
he spoke of him as "our revered and trusted chief." By a strange and
happy irony of fate, the statesman who had opposed the Boer war was
responsible for the policy of reconciliation which might have been much
harder if that war had not been waged.</p>

<p>Germany loomed large on the political horizon in 1908. This was the
year of Mr. Lloyd George's visit to inquire into the working of the
scheme of national insurance, a visit which <em>Punch</em> treated with
undisguised irony as a belated afterthought. It was also the year of
the Kaiser's famous interview, published in the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, in
which he claimed credit for magnanimity to England during the Boer war,
with the result of annoying his Chancellor and having to consent to a
revision of his conception of the Imperial prerogative. <em>Punch's</em> open
letter to "The Great Misunderstood" exhibits considerable scepticism of
his friendliness, and a set of verses, in the same spirit, are inspired
by the activities of the German Women's Navy League. An English M.P.
had been exhibiting a toy model of a German gunboat used by this
organization as a collecting box, and it was alleged that these toys
were handed about in German schools with the request: "Give us your
pence, so that we can thrash the English."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Kaiser's Soliloquy</em></div>

<p>The Kaiser's fiftieth birthday is commemorated in a "Soliloquy in
Berlin," in which the Emperor boasts of having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> swept aside Bismarck
and repressed the "too clamorous people" by police, prison or exile,
and defends his impulsive loquacity against his critics. The King must
know best, and "while all the discontented loose their tongues and rave
against him, shall the King be still?" Moreover, he claims to have kept
the world from war:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w30"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">And I have kept the peace. Was that well done?</p>

<p class="i0">was made for glorious battle, who could lead</p>
<p class="i0">Ten thousand thundering horsemen to the charge,</p>

<p class="center">"MUMMY, WHAT'S THAT MAN FOR?"</p>
</div>

<p>Simultaneously <em>Punch</em> illustrates the growing patriotic fervour at
home. Golfers are becoming shy of being detected on their way to or
from the links by men in uniform. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> <em>Punch</em> praises <em>An Englishman's
Home</em> as a "wonderful play," in which the case for national service
is presented "with rare tact, and void of offence even to the most
violent anti-militarist." Indeed, he goes so far as to admit that
the author's advocacy is impaired by his making the vulgar cheerful
young "slacker" delightfully human, while the good young patriot is
too stagey and talkative. German aggressiveness is illustrated in
the cartoon showing the German sailor adopting our "Jingo" song, the
copyright having expired. Editorially, though obliquely, <em>Punch</em>
deplores the subservience of vital questions of foreign policy to party
questions, and gives special praise to Sir Edward Grey. "Prenderby,"
who impersonates a detached view, pleads for a Coalition Cabinet&mdash;a
Ministry of all the patriots. In the spring of 1909 Mr. Asquith
figures as the Night Watchman who cries "All's well," but John Bull
from his window replies: "So you say. All the same, I shall sit up
for a bit." This was the time of the cry for more <em>Dreadnoughts</em>: "We
want Eight and we won't wait." The vote of censure on the Government
for their inadequate naval preparations was rejected by 353 votes to
135, and <em>Punch</em> satirized the Labour Party's idea of battleships in
a pictorial representation of H.M.S. <em>Inoffensive</em>, <em>Innocuous</em>, etc.
It is curious to find in another of <em>Punch's</em> editorial dialogues one
of the speakers constantly harping on what might happen in 1914 when
<em>Dreadnoughts</em> would be obsolete; while the happy-go-lucky attitude of
the average subaltern towards a possible war is expressed in the wish
attributed to one of them: "Let's hope it will come between the polo
and the huntin'." Lord Roberts's National Service Bill was thrown out
in the Lords in July by a narrow majority. <em>Punch's</em> artist is most
frankly honorific to Lord Roberts; but the summary of the debate given
by his Parliamentary representative is not even non-committal, for it
contrives to disparage Lord Milner while emphasizing the opposition of
the Duke of Northumberland and the caution of Lord Lansdowne.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Mr. Birrell as Chief Secretary</em></div>

<p>At the close of the year the impenitence of the Belgian administrators
of the Congo is held up to execration in the cartoon of the
slave-driver outside the European Hall of Deliberation, armed with a
whip, and saying, "I'm all right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> They're still talking"; while a
naked slave lies helpless and prostrate in the foreground.</p>

<p>After a brief and ineffectual tenure of office at the Board of
Education, Mr. Birrell had, whether out of heroic self-sacrifice
or ignorance, accepted the most thankless and arduous of all
portfolios&mdash;that of the Irish Chief Secretaryship. For the sequel, one
has to turn to the Report of the Hardinge Committee of Inquiry into the
Dublin revolution of Easter, 1916&mdash;one of the most lacerating public
documents ever devoted to the dissection of Ministerial incompetence.
But in 1909 there was, no doubt, much that appealed to <em>Punch</em> in the
notion of setting a professional humorist to govern a quick-witted
people. There never was a greater mistake. Much was and is forgiven to
a Minister who amuses the House, but the legacy of hatred, faithfully
cherished by those who forgot nothing but benefits received, was not
to be cancelled by epigrams which provoked the facile laughter of St.
Stephen's. There was, however, a probably quite unintended though extra
appropriateness in the title of the verses to him as "The Right Man in
the Wrong Place," for the chief ground of complaint against the Chief
Secretary was that he was conspicuous by his absence from Ireland at
all critical moments, and eclipsed the "Absentee landlords" at their
own game. In 1909 <em>Punch</em> contented himself with showing Mr. Birrell
as a Lecturer on Old Age Pensions as a means of allaying discontent,
and reducing the method to absurdity. The boon was naturally popular,
since, as <em>Punch</em> noted on good authority, it had been claimed and
received by more than 50,000 people not qualified under the Act.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Wait and See</em></div>

<p>In 1910 two general elections, fought on questions of internal policy,
and the conflict over the Parliament Bill diverted attention from
foreign politics. Lord Rosebery's scheme for the reform of the Upper
Chamber is treated in light-hearted fashion in the cartoon of the
Selection Committee of the Peers' Royal Academy. Lord Curzon and Lord
Lansdowne criticize Lord Rosebery's "problem picture": Lord Halsbury
bluntly ejaculates, "Take it away." <em>Punch</em>, however, recognized the
serious intentions of the Government in "The Constitution in the
Melting Pot," where Mr. Winston Churchill, Mr. Asquith and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> Mr. Lloyd
George are the three witches bending over the cauldron. The Unionists
had gained some ground in the January elections, but not nearly enough;
in December, when party feeling ran much higher, they failed to improve
their position, in spite of the offer of a Referendum to determine the
question of Tariff Reform, and of their insistent warnings as to the
danger of single-chamber Government. <em>Punch</em>, with some reserves, was

<div class="sidenote"><em>Death of King Edward</em></div>

<p>Perhaps the shrewdest comment on international politics made by <em>Punch</em>
in this year is to be found in his "Charivaria" column for November 9:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sir Edward Grey declared at Darlington that he saw no need for war.
Unfortunately, however, this is a great age for luxuries.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here <em>Punch</em> added a gloss to a wise truism. A remark in the Isle of
Man <em>Weekly Times</em> at the beginning of the year touched the nadir of
sordid parochialism. Discussing the "inevitableness" of a war with
Germany, the writer observed: "It would mean the ruination of the
Island. It would kill all chances of a successful season, upon which
the Island depends." <em>Punch</em> "lifted" the quotation, but here the text
beggared any comment.</p>

<p>By the assassination of the King and Crown Prince of Portugal in the
autumn, monarchy was ended in the country of our "Oldest Ally." <em>Punch</em>
denounced murder whether as the maker or unmaker of kings; and on
this occasion added to his condolences with the survivors a caustic
reference to France, who is shown briefly congratulating Portugal on
becoming a Republic; but she is "too busy to talk, having just escaped
another revolution at home"&mdash;an allusion to the railway strike and its
suppression by the drastic measures of M. Briand's Ministry. The death
of King Edward in May, at the height of his popularity and prestige,
was happily unattended by violence or upheaval, and left the position
of the Crown unshaken. <em>Punch</em> was not one of those who regarded
King Edward as the initiator of our foreign policy, but gratefully
acknowledged his services in smoothing the path of his Ministers:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The German Menace</em></div>

<p>In the winter of 1910 the German Crown Prince visited India, and was
welcomed and fêted wherever he went. <em>Punch</em> regarded the tour as
making for <em>rapprochement</em> and represented the Prince as an amiable
young sportsman writing home to "dear Papa" to say that he was "doing
himself proud and finding the English not half such bad fellows when
you get to know them." A more critical view of Germany's intentions is
revealed in the cartoon "The Blind Side," in which a German officer
applauds a Dutchman for the resolve to fortify his sea-front against
England as a true economy. It might be costly, but "see what you save
on the Eastern Frontier where there's nobody but us." A similar element
of misgiving is betrayed in "the New Haroun Al Raschid"&mdash;a dream of
Baghdad, "Made in Germany"&mdash;with the Kaiser in Oriental costume seated
on the engine of a "non-stop" express to the Persian Gulf.</p>

<p>Design for a figure of Britannia, as certain people would like to see

the Navy.)</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The War in Tripoli</em></div>

<p>In the spring of 1911 the proposed reduction of expenditure on the Navy
inspired <em>Punch's</em> "Little-Navy Exhibit"&mdash;a design for a figure of
Britannia, "as certain people would like to see her," with a pointless
trident, diminutive shield and helmet, in spectacles and elastic-sided
boots, leading a starveling lion with its tail between its legs.
Simultaneously Germany's idea of the <em>Pax Germanica</em> is satirized in
a picture of the Teuton Dovecote, with cannons pointing from each
door, surmounted by the German Eagle warning the Arbitration bird: "No
foreign doves required; we hatch our own, thank you." Our relations
with the U.S.A. are symbolized in "Dis-armageddon," President Taft
and Sir Edward Grey shaking hands over a grave with the notice, "All
hatchets may be buried here." Hostility to the "Declaration of London"
had grown throughout the year. It had been described as "a sword for
the Unionist Party"; picture posters represented the destruction under
it of neutral ships carrying food to Great Britain, and <em>Punch</em>,
without going the lengths of the <em>Morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> Post</em>, the Imperial Maritime
League, or Mr. T. Gibson Bowles, was far from enthusiastic over its
ratification. "I'm sure," his Britannia remarks, looking at herself in
the glass, "my costumiers want me to look my best. But I have a sort
of feeling that this thing may rather hamper my sea-legs." Germany's
complaints against the policy of "isolating" or "surrounding" her
were now frequently heard, and are unsympathetically treated in the
portrait of the German officer in full uniform, with his knuckles to
his eyes, dolorously protesting, "Nobody loves me&mdash;and they all want
to trample on me!" Nor was <em>Punch</em> inclined to look more favourably
on Italy's policy of aggrandisement in North Africa. The inglorious
war with Turkey in Cyrenaica brought no credit to the combatants or
to the Concert of Europe. <em>Punch</em> summed up the situation by showing
Dame Europa (of the Hague Academy for Young Gentlemen) looking sourly
with folded arms at two boys "scrapping" in a corner, and observing,
"I thoroughly disapprove of this, and as soon as ever it's over I
shall interfere to put a stop to it." The conduct of the war led to
ugly charges against the Italians, and in "The Euphemisms of Massacre"
Turkey, surveying a scene of carnage at Tripoli, sarcastically remarks:
"When <em>I</em> was charged with this kind of thing in Bulgaria, nobody
excused <em>me</em> on the ground of 'military exigencies'!"</p>

<p>The Anglo-Russian agreement in regard to Persia was defended by Sir
Edward Grey in November, 1911, as having ended friction between the
two Powers. <em>Punch</em> thought otherwise, and in December he showed the
Bear cheerfully sitting on the tail of the Persian Cat while the
British Lion remarks: "If we hadn't such a thorough understanding
I might almost be tempted to ask what you're doing there with our
little play-fellow." Yet Sir Edward Grey's explanations satisfied the
Unionists better than the advanced Liberals and the Labour Party.
Already the Government were being attacked for seeing events through
French spectacles, and in a memorable cartoon <em>Punch</em> recorded
the emergence of the demand for "The New Diplomacy." An "Advanced
Democrat," having made his way into a room with "Private. Members Only"
on the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> remarks to the Foreign Secretary: "Look here, we've
decided that this isn't to be a private room any more; and you're to
put your cards on the table and then we can all take a hand." Whereon
Sir Edward Grey replies: "What, and let my opponents see them too?" In
this context one may be permitted to recall a picture, published about
the same time, of a constable applying a familiar test to a belated
reveller protesting his sobriety:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Constable</span>: "Can you say 'British Constitution'?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belated One</span> (<em>with strongest "Die-Hard" convictions</em>): "There
ishn't one now!"</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Punch's</em> Almanack for 1912 treats of current events in a light-hearted
spirit. There is one picture, however, with an ominous and prophetic
heading, "Period&mdash;The War of 1914," in which an irate M.F.H. abuses the
invaders&mdash;unmistakable Germans&mdash;for heading the fox. The artist, Mr. J.
L. C. Booth, a very gallant gentleman, fell in Gallipoli in 1915. But
there were other and more unmistakable omens at the opening of the New
Year, when M. Caillaux, before resigning, had attempted to reconstruct
his Cabinet with M. Delcassé as Foreign Minister&mdash;a situation typified
by <em>Punch</em> in his cartoon of "The return of the scapegoat." M. Caillaux
resigned under a cloud; M. Delcassé failed to form a Government,
but remained on as Minister of Marine under M. Poincaré. For the
moment Germany's troubles at home diverted attention from her foreign
relations. The demands of the Socialists are illustrated in the
dialogue between the Kaiser on the summit of a rocky peak and a figure
climbing up to the summit. "What business have you here?" asks the
Kaiser, and the Socialist answers: "I, too, want 'a place in the sun.'"</p>

<p>In March the Navy estimates issued by Mr. Churchill as First Lord were
expressly stated to be conditional upon the naval programmes of other
nations: <em>Punch</em> accordingly showed him as the Plain Dealer hoisting
as his signal "England expects that every nation will do its duty&mdash;by
not increasing its armaments." The rival views on naval concentration
are shown a little later in the "Geography Lesson" given by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> "Dr."
Kitchener&mdash;Lord Kitchener had gone to Egypt as Agent-General in the
previous year&mdash;to Master Churchill and Master Asquith. "What do you
know about the Mediterranean?" he asks, and Master Churchill replies:
"Well, it looks a nice place for ships; but, to tell you the truth,
we've been concentrating our attention on the North Sea lately, haven't
we, Herbert?" and Master Asquith replies: "That is so."</p>

<p>The appointment of Baron Marschall von Bieberstein as German Ambassador
in London was well received. He was Germany's strongest diplomatist.
He had raised the prestige of his country to an unexampled pitch at
Constantinople without losing the respect of his British colleagues,
and was credited with the desire to promote a better understanding with
England. Unfortunately he died suddenly before <em>Punch's</em> expectations
could be realized. Meanwhile Mr. Haldane at the War Office had "turned
turtle (dove)" to such an extent that in <em>Punch's</em> view his occupation
was nearly gone. Yet the travesty of Dicksee's "Harmony," with the
Kaiser playing on a Krupp organ to a stout and adoring Germany, is
by no means reassuring. Consols were steadily "slumping," and the
organized resistance of Ulster was already regarded as serious.
<em>Punch's</em> views in the course of the next few years underwent a good
deal of modification, but he was never sympathetic to Sir Edward
Carson. When the old cry, "Ulster will fight," was raised to discredit
the son of the statesman who had invented the phrase, <em>Punch</em> called it
"a silly game. If Ulster fights against free speech, then Ulster will
be wrong." When the "Covenant" of Resistance to Home Rule was signed
by the Ulster Loyalists in September, 1912, <em>Punch</em> satirized their
action under the heading "Ulster will write," with General Carson on
horseback, waving a pen and crying, "Up, nibs, and at 'em!"</p>

<p class="center">THE BOILING POINT</p>
</div>

<p><em>Punch</em>, it is to be feared, did not credit the Balkan League with
exalted ideals in entering on the conflict with Turkey in 1912.
Bulgaria, in his cartoon of August 28, challenges Turkey, at grips with
Italy, to mortal combat, and Turkey replies: "Certainly," adding to
Italy, "I hope you won't think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> me discourteous if I cannot continue
to give you my undivided attention." Two months later we are shown
the Great Powers all sitting on the seething pot of "Balkan troubles"
but unable to keep the lid down. By November a "New Eagle" with four
heads&mdash;Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro and Greece&mdash;is seen approaching the
door of the Council of Europe. More acute in its reading of the signs
of the times is the picture of Turkey, a sinister figure, rubbing his
hands as he reads the placard: "Austria threatens Serbia. European
Crisis," and saying, "Good! If only all those other Christian nations
get at one another's throats, I may have a dog's chance yet"&mdash;a
situation realized by the launching of the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia
in July, 1914. Early in December an armistice was agreed to, and by
the middle of the month a conference of Balkan delegates assembled in
London. The deliberations of the Peace Conference continued till the
end of the year, but in the Christmas cartoon of "Prince Charming and
the Sleeping Beauty," Sir Edward Grey has not yet succeeded in inducing
Peace to wake up. As a matter of fact, the Conference was suspended on
January 6, 1913, on the 26th the Balkan delegates broke off further
negotiations with the Porte, and on February 3 war was resumed.
<em>Punch's</em> comment on the threatened intervention of Roumania was
severe but not unmerited; the "Bayard of Bukharest" observes politely
to Bulgaria, "I am sure, dear old friend, you will wish to recompense
me for not stabbing you in the back from behind in the previous bout,
and I am therefore proposing to anticipate your kindness by making off
with your coat (Silistria)." Sir Edward Grey's hope, expressed in the
House of Commons in March, that Turkey would now confine its energies
to "consolidating" itself in Asia Minor, met with ironical approval
from <em>Punch</em>, who in the following month represented Turkey responding
to Europa's complacent assurance that the war was "practically over"
with the still more complacent comment: "My felicitations, Madam.
Everything seems to point to the outbreak of a sanguinary peace." And
unfortunately the cynical anticipation was only too well verified in
the sequel. King Nicholas's defiance marked the opening stages of the
new conflict&mdash;typified in the Montenegrin bantam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> blocking the road
for the great Powers, but getting out of the way at the last moment.
Skutari was occupied by troops of the Powers on May 14, and on May
30 the Treaty of Peace between the Allies and the Porte was signed
at St. James's Palace. But <em>Punch</em>, in his cartoon of "Peace comes
to Town," was not unfair in making Sir Edward Grey adjure the fair
damsel riding behind him to sit close and not slip off as on the last
occasion they fared that way together. So many outstanding questions
remained unsettled that a pacific solution was impossible; the Balkan
war was resumed on June 30. Bulgaria put up a great fight against the
Serbians and Greeks, but the advance of the fresh Roumanian army into
her territory rendered her position desperate. <em>Punch</em> had already
shown Turkey offering its services as benevolent mediator to the Balkan
"allies." Before the end of the month the Turks had re-entered the
field and re-occupied Adrianople only three months after they had been
driven out. "Quite like old times, being back here," the Turk says to
Dame Europa in <em>Punch's</em> cartoon, and when Europa replies, "Ah! but
you'll be kicked out, you know," he retorts calmly, "Well, that'll
be like old times too." An armistice was signed on July 31, and the
second Treaty of Peace was signed by Bulgaria, Greece, Montenegro
and Serbia on August 10. Bulgaria, whose losses in the two wars had
been very heavy, was seriously penalized by the new adjustment of
boundaries and the consequent loss of territory. Roumania was cordially
congratulated by the Kaiser for her "wise and statesmanlike policy,"
and Greece, who gained a vast acquisition of territory around Salonika,
expressed through the mouth of King Constantine&mdash;King George had been
assassinated at Salonika in March&mdash;her indebtedness to Germany for
the war training of her officers. <em>Punch's</em> comment was sardonic. In
"<em>Deutschland über Alles</em>" the King of the Hellenes observes to the
Kaiser, "Our success, as you know, was entirely due to you," and the
Kaiser replies: "Thanks, thanks," adding, aside, "I suppose he can't be
referring to our organization of the Turkish army."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Balkan Cockpit</em></div>

<p>The attitude of the Concert of Powers over the question of Adrianople
is indicated in the cartoon in which Sir Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> Grey tells the Turk,
the man in possession, that he will have to go, but that the Powers
haven't decided who was to turn him out. European intervention proving
hopeless, the matter was left for direct negotiations between Bulgaria
and Turkey, with the result that the new frontier gave Turkey about one
hundred square miles more territory together with Adrianople. <em>Punch</em>,
on the eve of the signature of the treaty, anticipated the triumph of
Turkey, who is seen pasting up, on the door of the Hotel Adrianople,
a notice, "Under the same old management," over a previous notice,
"Under entirely new management," and expressing regret at being unable
to oblige Europa by retiring. Europa, with the Treaty of London in her
hand, saves her face by replying with dignity: "Not at all. You may
remember that at the very start I strongly insisted on the <em>status
quo</em>." The Powers had decided at the close of 1912 that Albania was
to receive autonomy, but the International Commission of Control was
unable to check guerrilla fighting between Serbians and Albanians.
Europa found it, in <em>Punch's</em> phrase, a very difficult task to hush
the infant Albania; and Prince William of Wied, chosen by the Powers
as sovereign, or "Mpret" of Albania in November, 1913, excited more
ridicule than sympathy during his brief and troubled tenure of office.</p>

<p>The Balkan wars, which began in an organized attempt to liberate
Christians from the Turkish yoke, developed into an internecine
struggle for aggrandisement amongst the members of the League. The
Balkan Peninsula unhappily justified its description as "the cockpit of
Europe," or, to quote the words of a traveller who visited it between
the first and second wars: "one vast madhouse, where sanity seems
ridiculous and folly wisdom." The Treaty of Bukharest, so far from
allaying discord, only fomented the ambitions which precipitated the
world conflict.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Ulster Bars the Way</em></div>

<p>France's reversion to three years' service&mdash;applauded by <em>Punch</em> in
his cartoon "<em>Pour la Patrie</em>"&mdash;had been countered by the German Army
Bill introduced by the new German Chancellor, Bethmann-Hollweg, in a
somewhat ominous speech in April. <em>Punch</em> had already symbolized the
acceleration of the armament race in his picture of Hans and Jacques,
each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> bowed down under a tremendous burden of warlike equipment,
exclaiming in rueful unison: "And I hear there's more to come."</p>

<p>Mr. Churchill's scheme of a naval holiday inspired hopes which were
partially shared by <em>Punch</em>, but damped by the German Chancellor's
speech on the ground that the idea had not been taken up as practical
in England either by Parliament or public opinion. The renewal of
Mr. Churchill's suggestion later in the year met with an even more
unfavourable reception. Admiral Tirpitz makes his <em>début</em> in <em>Punch</em> as
an apostle of German naval expansion; General Bernhardi had followed up
his notorious book on <em>Germany and the Next War</em> with articles pointing
to Ireland as an ally of Germany in the enemy's camp; and the outrages
on Alsatian civilians by German officers at Zabern and Metz emphasized
the danger of militarism at home as well as abroad. The incident was
historic because it was the first notable example of the cleavage
between the army and the people in Germany, the Radicals and Socialists
having carried a vote of censure in the Reichstag against the Imperial
Chancellor. The war closed all ranks for a time; but Zabern was a straw
which showed how the wind was beginning to blow&mdash;the wind which became
a tempest in the autumn of 1918.</p>

<p>If Great Britain in 1913 was not exactly a cockpit or a madhouse, she
was not without her domestic troubles. One of the earliest cartoons
of the year exhibits the Home Rule Bill advancing under the shield of
the Parliament Act. The advance was barred by Ulster, for this was the
year of the formation of the Provisional Government, the enrolment of
the Ulster volunteers, proclamations against the importation of arms,
the emergence of "King Carson," and a general recrudescence of party
acrimony. <em>Punch</em>, in a laudable desire to see ourselves as others see
us, depicted in "A Nation of Fire-Eaters" a peaceful Teuton horrified
by a placard enumerating all the "armies" in Great Britain&mdash;the Ulster
Volunteer army, Miss Sylvia Pankhurst's army, Mr. Devlin's army,
etc. The spirit of the picture is ironical, but it throws a light on
Bernhardi's reading of the signs of the times in Ireland. In July Mr.
Asquith is seen endeavouring to cajole the Orange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> Girl, who looks
at him sullenly; and another picture in the same number shows Sir
Edward Carson arming "Loyal Ulster." In October the possibility of
a settlement on the basis of the exclusion of North-East Ulster is
indicated in "Second Thoughts"; Mr. John Redmond is shown driving four
pigs&mdash;Connaught, Munster, Leinster and S.W. Ulster&mdash;through the gate
of Home Rule. N.E. Ulster is heading in a contrary direction, and Mr.
Redmond wonders whether he should "lave this contrairy little divil
loose the way he'd come back by himself aftherwards." A month or so
later Mr. Birrell warns Carson not to tempt him or "on my honour and
conscience I shall have to put you through this." <em>This</em> being the
"ever open door" of a prison with the inscription "All fear abandon ye
who enter here"&mdash;a reference to the speedy release of Mr. Jim Larkin,
the turbulent leader of the Dublin strike. Here the satire is aimed at
the futile leniency of the Chief Secretary to all disturbers of the
peace. Three weeks later, alluding to the prohibited importation of
arms into Ireland, <em>Punch</em> ridicules the inconsistency of Sir Edward
Carson, who, armed himself to the teeth, is warning Customs Officer
Birrell to search Mr. Redmond, a harmless-looking passenger, carrying a
small dispatch-case: "That's just the sort of bag he'd have a couple of
howitzers concealed in." Mr. Bonar Law's support of Sir Edward Carson's
campaign is ingeniously shown in "The New Brunswicker"&mdash;after Millais'
well-known picture&mdash;deserting the Tariff Reform lady, "but only for a
time," in order to go to the Ulster Wars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Lloyd George</span>: "Yes, you must; and there's more to come."</p>
</div>

<p>The last cartoon of the year, "The Third Stage," exhibits the main
legislative preoccupations of the year in the form of a coach with
the three Bills&mdash;Home Rule, Welsh Disestablishment and Plural
Voting&mdash;seated abreast under the hood of the Parliament Act with 1914
as postilion. <em>Punch's</em> view was that the electorate as a whole were
somewhat weary of the legislative activities of the Government. In 1912
he had represented John Bull as Oliver asking not for more but less;
in the summer of 1913 he showed John Bull disappointed with Mr. Lloyd
George's "rare and refreshing fruit" on the ground that it contained
"too many pips," <em>à propos</em> of Mr. Asquith's promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> to amend the
Insurance Act. The conscientious M.P., in the cartoon of a few weeks
later, who presents himself at the Pay Office expressing his fear
that he won't "really be earning his salary this year with no autumn
session," is bluntly told by Paymaster Bull, "sick with legislation,"
not to worry about that. "You go and take a nice long holiday; the
country needs it." There were other causes of weariness besides
excessive legislation. The Marconi scandal was an incubus which lay
heavily on the Government throughout the year. In the early stages of
the inquiry, <em>Punch</em> showed Rumour presenting her season-ticket, and
disgusted at being denied admittance, as the Committee were about to
"get to business." The amount of space devoted to the question in the
Press is satirized by the announcement of the forthcoming publication
of "The Marconi Affair in a Nut-shell," by Messrs. Garvin and Maxse, in
968 pages. When the Report appeared, <em>Punch</em> thought the whitewash had
been laid on too thick:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"More Whitewash!" said the Falconer,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a></p>
<p class="i0">"Throw it about in bucketfuls;</p>
<p class="i2">Some of it's bound to stick."</p>
<p class="i0">"Very poor art!" the public cried;</p>
<p class="i2">"You've laid it on too thick!"</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Even more hostile is the cartoon "Blameless Telegraphy," in which
John Bull addresses Mr. Lloyd George and Sir Rufus Isaacs, dressed as
telegraph boys with "Marconi, U.S.A.," on their caps: "My boys, you
leave the court without a stain&mdash;except, perhaps, for the whitewash."
There was no whitewash in Lord Robert Cecil's minority Report; and the
reverberations of the Marconi affair did not die down for many months,
nor did <em>Punch</em> wish that they should&mdash;witness his ironic cartoon of
the Master of Elibank, luxuriating in a hammock in tropical Bogota, and
expressing his keen disappointment that the inquiry had been closed.</p>

<p class="center">THE WINGS OF VICTORY</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Britannia</span>: "These things seem all the rage in Paris and
Berlin; and I really can't afford to be out of it!"</p>
</div>

<p><em>A propos</em> of the theft of the "Mona Lisa" portrait from the Louvre,
<em>Punch</em> portrayed Mr. Asquith as "Il Giocondo" with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> an inscrutable and
enigmatic smile. The internal embarrassments of the Cabinet certainly
must have taxed the smiling capacities of the Premier to the utmost,
to say nothing of Ulster and the militant suffragists. Yet when Dame
Curzon is depicted tempting Master Asquith to take a joy-ride on a
donkey labelled "General Election," Master Asquith replies that he is
not taking any violent exercise this season, but thinks of waiting till
1915. There are not a few people who in the interests of the country
are very thankful that the Liberals were still in power and not in
opposition when the great decision had to be made a year later. There
is a touch of unconscious and complacent prophecy in the picture of
Britannia girding on "The Wings of Victory"&mdash;the new rage in Paris and
Berlin&mdash;"because she can't afford to be out of it." It took us four
years to make good the title, but it was done in the end.</p>

<p>The gap that separates us from pre-war years is illustrated in many
curious ways. For example, in March, 1913, <em>Punch</em> has a picture of a
lady asking to have a cheque for £15 cashed all in gold "if you've got
it." In those golden days of peace such a question was simply a mark of
feminine ignorance; two years later it would have argued insanity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>England's Detachment</em></div>

<p>In the seven months that remained before the outbreak of the Great
War you may search the pages of <em>Punch</em> in vain for evidences of
a provocative attitude towards Germany or of anything indicating
national preparedness for the conflict. <em>Punch</em>, as a mirror of
middle-class public opinion, faithfully reflected our domestic troubles
and preoccupations. International politics are conspicuously absent
from the Almanack of Christmas, 1913, except for a picture of Sir
Edward Grey producing doves from a hat labelled Balkan Crisis, and
portraits of Ferdinand of Bulgaria, the Sultan of Turkey and the
King of Montenegro, offering tickets of admission to the Concert of
Europe. Comment, criticism and satire are monopolized by Ulster,
labour troubles, Marconi and oil scandals, the dancing mania, social
extravagance and the spread of the cinema habit. The first cartoon of
the New Year of 1914 is devoted to Mr. Lloyd George's land campaign;
there is nothing aggressive in the picture of Mr. Churchill as a
sailor surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> by a Tory chorus singing, "You've made me love you;
I didn't want to do it"&mdash;<em>à propos</em> of the Navy Estimates; nothing
provocative in "The Price of Admiralty," where Britannia, outside a
door marked "Cabinet Council (Private and Controversial)," is seen
waiting to know whether she is to lay down the ships she wants, on
which <em>Mr. Punch</em> adds "or lay down your trident." No serious misgiving
is aroused by Turkey's purchase of a <em>Dreadnought</em>, and <em>Punch's</em>
comment on General Leonard Wood's pessimistic report on the practically
unarmed condition of the U.S.A. army, if not exactly unsympathetic, is
light-hearted and detached.</p>

<p>Home Rule and the attitude of Ulster diverted the eyes of England
from the Continent. The Zabern incident did not escape <em>Punch's</em> eye,
but his comment, which suggests an imaginary interchange of garrisons
between Germany and England, was too fantastic to be really pointed;
and the announcement that Sir Edward Grey would accompany the King
on his visit to Paris in April passes with a brief compliment to the
Foreign Minister on his well-earned little treat.</p>

<p>There is an excellent burlesque account of a Cabinet Council in
February, illustrating the temperaments of the different Ministers&mdash;the
imperturbable and irrepressible equanimity of Mr. Lloyd George; the
inarticulate disapproval of Lord Crewe; the egotism of Mr. Burns; the
bland ignorance of Mr. Birrell. But foreign politics are not once
mentioned: the Premier and his Cabinet are chiefly concerned with
discussing their detractors in the Press and the Ulster problem.
Incidentally Mr. Lloyd George scouts the proposal to revive the
Heptarchy because it was a Saxon, not a Celtic institution. This is
all irresponsible burlesque, but it was highly intelligent burlesque.
In Parliament, members were not worrying about the German menace.
They were more interested in Lord Murray's statement about the
Marconi business, the debate on contributions to the Party funds and
the distribution of honours; above all, in the Government's plan of
amending Home Rule so as to conciliate Ulster. <em>Punch</em>, still inclined
to be critical of the Northern loyalists, begs Miss Ulster not to turn
up her nose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> at the pretty bouquet of concessions offered her by the
Premier, but to have a good look at them first.</p>

<p>The Government certainly did not expect war, but whether by lucky
chance or in a moment of wise prevision, a momentous decision was taken
by the Admiralty in March:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Admiralty has decided that, in the place of the grand
manoeuvres this year, there shall be a surprise mobilisation. Last
year's manoeuvres were, we believe, something of a fiasco, but to
ensure the success of the surprise mobilisation, five months' previous
notice is given."</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Punch's</em> comment, at any rate, is free from any bellicose imputations.
He, at least, had no inkling of the larger surprise which was to be
sprung on us from another quarter. The Supplementary Naval Estimates,
raising the total to 48 millions, and providing for reserves of oil
fuel and the very modest new aircraft programme, were passed by a six
to one majority. Labour members registered a protest, but nothing
was said about Germany. Home Rule, Welsh Disestablishment and Plural
Voting still were the burning questions of the hour. As for Home Rule,
it is strange to read how, in the debate on the second reading in
March, Mr. William O'Brien referred to Ulster as "the new 'Orange'
Free State, which has just received official recognition." <em>Punch</em>
records the phrase; also the vote of censure brought against Mr. Lloyd
George "on grounds of repeated inaccuracy, particularly on account of
his ineradicable tendency to speak disrespectfully of dukes"&mdash;a vote
negatived by none too large a majority. Mr. Balfour meanwhile was
disporting himself at Nice, and his absence was much commented on:
it was not exactly a case of Nero fiddling while Rome was burning;
but <em>Punch</em>, under the heading of "Mr. Balfour's Mixed Double Life,"
made fair game of his giving up to lawn tennis what was meant for his
country. Another conspicuous absentee from England at this period of
storm and stress was Lord Northcliffe. A notice appeared in the <em>Daily
Mail</em> in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lord Northcliffe rarely sees and never reads a letter, being mainly
nowadays engaged in golf and travel.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Punch</em> treated the announcement with a sad want of respect, as who
should say, "<em>O si sic semper!</em>" The most curious thing in <em>Punch's</em>
pages for March is the picture of the Recruiting Sergeant addressing a
rather loutish-looking youth: "Now I can tell character when I see it,
so mark my words. If you join now, you'll be a swankin' general in five
years." Thus not for the first time did <em>Punch</em>, writing as a jester,
prove an unconscious prophet.</p>

<p class="center">"THERE'S MANY A SLIP ..."</p>
</div>

<p>Credit is assigned to Mr. Churchill for "calling in a new element to
redress the balance of the old"&mdash;Neptune emerging from the deep to
gaze at his new allies, the aeroplane and airship. But attention was
abruptly switched off from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> Admiralty to the War Office by the
troubles at the Curragh Camp, the threatened resignations of General
Gough and other officers as a protest against the coercion of Ulster,
and by the blunder and resignation of Mr. Seely. <em>Punch</em> applauded the
spirit both of Ulster and the Army: in his cartoon, "Many a slip,"
he showed Mr. Asquith, while offering the cup to Mr. John Redmond,
confronted by a hand with a sword marked "Army Resignations." <em>Punch</em>
recognized the promptitude with which Mr. Asquith came to the rescue
by doubling the functions of Premier and War Minister, but was less
benevolent in his gloss on the comment of a faithful supporter who
declared that "the best we can do is to keep our eye on Mr. Asquith":&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No orders were issued, no orders are likely to be issued, and no
orders will be issued for the coercion of Ulster."</p></blockquote>

<p>But when his speech was printed in the weekly record, it was found that
the word "immediate" had been added before "coercion," thus showing
that self-protection is often the most dangerous and damaging policy.</p>

<p class="center">THE ULSTER KING-AT-ARMS</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Ulster and the "Plot"</em></div>

<p><em>Punch</em> had applauded the spirit of Ulster, but he did not approve of
the uncompromising policy of her leader. In "The Fight for the Banner,"
Mr. John Redmond and Sir Edward Carson are shown pulling the flag of
"Peace for Ireland" asunder, while John Bull remarks: "This tires
me. Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> can't you carry it between you? Neither of you can carry it
alone." By way of contrast, one may note the cartoon "After Ten Years,"
with France and Britannia clasping hands in celebration of the solidity
and endurance of the <em>Entente</em>.</p>

<p>"For the third time in the course of three successive Sessions the
Home Rule Bill passes the second reading stage." So <em>Punch</em> wrote of
the "business done" in Parliament on April 6. But the arbitrament of
the vote did not allay the suspicions of the Opposition. April and
May were given over to acrimonious discussions of the alleged "Plot"
by the Government to overawe Ulster by armed occupation. <em>Punch</em>
admired the imperturbability of Mr. Asquith, who is shown combining
in his own person the <em>rôles</em> of prisoner, judge and jury. Mr. Austen
Chamberlain demanded a judicial inquiry into the "Plot," but was beaten
by eighty votes in a House of 608 members. Simultaneously <em>Punch</em>
depicted Sir Edward Carson as the Ulster King-at-Arms, armed and
defiant, and declared through the mouth of John Bull that "he was not
going to have Civil War to please either Radical Extremists or Tory
Die-Hards." Simultaneously, too, <em>Punch</em> printed a most eulogistic
notice of Mr. Norman Angell's <em>Foundations of International Policy</em>,
in which the reviewer declared that if he were a politician he would
"move for a further supplementary Naval Estimate to expend the price
of a <em>Dreadnought</em> in distributing this fighting pacificist's book to
all journalists, attachés, clergymen, bazaar-openers, club oracles,
professors, headmasters, and other obvious people in both Germany and
Britain."</p>

<p>Mr. Lloyd George's last Budget topped two hundred millions, but showed
a small surplus. <em>Punch</em> portrayed the income-tax payer as an old cow
complaining that "it isn't milking, it's murder." The enhancement of
the death duties <em>Punch</em> regarded as a raising of the fares to Styx,
which would cost the Plutocratic Shades more.</p>

<p>The debates on the Home Rule Bill suggested to <em>Punch</em> a contrast
between 1906 and 1914, the efforts of the Liberals to improve the
situation having only resulted in turmoil, discontent and bitter
recrimination. The third reading was carried on May 25 by 351 votes to
274, Mr. William O'Brien having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> cheerfully remarked that the Bill,
if it became an Act, would be born with a rope round its neck. Heated
discussions took place over the refusal of the Government to disclose
the details of the Amending Bill. The Speaker had invited Mr. Asquith
to supply further particulars, as the Opposition had insistently
demanded, but, according to <em>Punch</em>, the Premier's luminous and
courteous response did not add a syllable to the information already
vouchsafed, whereupon Mr. Bonar Law had asked the Speaker to "let the
curtain be rung down on a contemptible farce." The third reading of the
Welsh Disestablishment Bill had been carried a week earlier; the Plural
Voters Bill passed the same stage three weeks later. For the rest, the
main topics which engaged attention in the House were gun-running,
Suffragist outrages, and the latest amendment of the much-amended
Insurance Act. "Scenes" were not infrequent, and <em>Punch</em> deplores the
"pot-house manners" displayed by members on both sides. The emergence
of the National Volunteers, a counterblast to the force enrolled by
the Ulster Loyalists, added to the general disquiet, but there were no
public signs of any general awakening to the impending catastrophe. Sir
Percy Scott's letter on the submarine menace created a considerable
stir, but <em>Punch</em>, like the majority of his readers, refused to treat
it seriously. The efficiency of the Territorial Army as seen from the
inside is illustrated in the <em>cri de coeur</em> ascribed to one of the
rank and file during the course of the manoeuvres: "Thank 'Evin we've
got a Nivy!" There is a jocular reference in mid-June to the toast
"Der Tag" in German war vessels, and an unconscious prophecy in the
warning of an old Lancashire lady to a young friend intending to go
by an excursion to London: "Doan't thee goà to London: thee stop in
owd England." On June 10, it may be added, a "Peace Centenary Costume
Ball" was held in the Albert Hall in honour of the 100th anniversary
of peace between Great Britain and the United States, and the lady who
represented Britannia carried a palm branch instead of the customary
trident.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Midsummer Madness</em></div>

<p>With the opening of July the London season was in full fling; the
pleasure-hunt had never been so unbridled; midsummer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> madness was at
its height. Society, bejewelled as never before, was given up to the
cult of the Russian Ballet and the worship of Chaliapine. <em>Punch's</em>
"Holiday Pages" make strange reading, emphasizing, as they do, the
passion for amusement, freak and fancy costumes, the cinema craze and
"full joy days." <em>Punch's</em> staff did not escape the infection, and one
of them writes from a golfing resort:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w30"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"<em>Carpe diem</em>"&mdash;yes, that's the motto.</p>
<p class="i0">"Work be jiggered!" and likewise "What ho!"</p>
<p class="i0"><em>I'm not going back till I've jolly well got to!</em></p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Strauss's <em>Joseph</em> had been produced in June by the Russian Ballet, and
lent point to "Blanche's" letter on the "Friendship Fête," an imaginary
entertainment organized "to celebrate our not having had any scraps
with any foreign country for some little time" by the performance of a
Kamschatkan opera-ballet. The satire is effective, but it is largely
unconscious or subconscious. The Smith-Carpentier fight made a greater
impression on the man in the street than the murder of the Crown Prince
Ferdinand at Sarajevo.</p>

<p>The death of Mr. Chamberlain, who, after long enforced absence from the
political arena, passed away on July 2, hushed political strife for a
moment. All sections were united in deploring the tragic eclipse of a
great fighter and a great man who, in <em>Punch's</em> words, "loved his Party
well but loved his country more."</p>

<p>Turkey appears early in the month as unready to fight Greece before the
autumn, "when the ships come home." The cartoons until the last issue
in July deal with the Budget and Home Rule. Mr. Asquith on July 13
announced the winding up of business; there would be no autumn session,
but Parliament would reassemble early in the winter. On July 29 the
chief cartoon, "What of the Dawn?" deals with the anxieties of Ireland,
and the most important event chronicled in the "Essence of Parliament"
was the Premier's announcement that, on the initiative of the King,
a conference on the Ulster question between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> British and Irish
parties had been arranged to meet at Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p><em>Punch</em> was not wholly blind to the peril of Serbia. In his second
cartoon, "The Power Behind," we see the Austrian Eagle threatening
the little Serbian bird and suspecting that someone must be backing
him&mdash;the someone being the Russian Bear hidden behind a rock. The
immediate situation was not misread, but <em>Punch</em>, in his own words,
was in an "irrepressible holiday mood," and little thought that on the
day on which his cartoon appeared Austria would declare war on Serbia.
Yet even this warning did not bring home to <em>Punch</em> the imminence
of the "Grand Smash." The makers of wars have no consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> for
the producers of weekly papers. The issue, dated August 5, had gone
to press before Germany declared war on Russia and France, and was
published only a few hours before Great Britain was at war with
Germany. The cartoon of the week shows Britannia appealing to Peace
to do the best for her in <em>Ireland</em>, having done her best for Peace
in Europe.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a> The "Essence of Parliament" is more concerned with

<p>An even more detached and ironical note is sounded in the fantasy
headed "Armageddon"&mdash;a satire on Porkins, a blatant young golfing "nut"
who thinks that England needs a war to cure her of flabbiness. The
granting of his desire is traced to the cynical intervention of the
Gods of Olympus in promoting a little scrap over a love affair in an
obscure corner of the Balkans:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And when a year later the hundred-thousandth English mother woke up to
read that her boy had been shot, I am afraid she shed foolish tears
and thought that the world had come to an end. Poor shortsighted
creature! She didn't realize that Porkins, who had marched round the
links in ninety-six the day before, was now thoroughly braced up.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These two utterances may show that <em>Punch</em> had failed in reading the
signs of the times, and did not render justice to the youth of the
country. I prefer to regard them as proofs that <em>Punch</em>, like the vast
majority of his fellow-countrymen, neither expected nor desired war.</p>

<h2><a name="CAPITAL_AND_LABOUR" id="CAPITAL_AND_LABOUR">CAPITAL AND LABOUR</a></h2>

<p>The fervid Radicalism of <em>Punch's</em> earlier years had always been
tempered by a distrust of "agitators" and socialistic experiments. It
is impossible to deny that, in the period under review in this volume,
this distrust gained in force if not in vehemence. There is nothing
so bitter as the sketch of the delegate which appeared in the days of
Douglas Jerrold (see Vol. I, p. 50), but the general attitude of the
paper to the working man is decidedly less sympathetic. This change can
be illustrated negatively as well as positively; less space is devoted
to "the people," and more to "Society"&mdash;though in many cases it is
suburban society&mdash;and to the middle classes. The references to Labour
exhibit an increasing tendency to criticize and denounce trade union
tyranny, socialistic legislation, the improvidence and extravagance of
highly paid workmen, and "ergophobia" (as <em>Punch</em> academically calls
work-shyness)&mdash;a habit which he describes as early as 1892 as "the new
employment of being 'unemployed.'" Yet if <em>Punch</em> was increasingly
critical of Labour&mdash;organized Labour&mdash;he was very far from being a
thick-and-thin champion of Capital. Greedy employers and directors are
never spared. The agricultural depression in 1892 furnishes him with
the occasion for a vigorous onslaught on railway rates. Agriculture is
shown as a female figure, bound hand and foot by Foreign Competition,
lying prostrate on the track and about to be run down by an engine
labelled Railway Rates. In 1895 the verses and cartoon inspired by
lock-outs on the Clyde are equally severe on the employers. <em>Punch</em>
condemns the action of "crass and unpatriotic capital," and shows
Britannia rebuking the shipbuilders who are playing into Germany's
hands by assisting the growth of her navy. In 1896, under the heading
of "The Millions to the Millionaires," <em>Punch</em> takes for his text
an actual appeal made by the working men of Walworth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> on the death
of Baron Hirsch, <em>à propos</em> of his munificent bequests to <em>his</em>
countrymen, and holds up the example for imitation. The continuance
of the habit of "slumming," out of curiosity rather than good will,
prompts in 1897 a satirical inversion of the organized visits to the
East End. <em>Punch's</em> "West End Exploration Agency, Ltd.," provided
"Night Tours through Belgravia and Lightest London" with the purpose
of proving "the depressing monotony and triviality of the existence to
which Fashion's merciless decree condemns her countless thousands of
white slaves."</p>

<p>The debate in the Commons in the same year over Lord Penrhyn's dispute
with his quarrymen found <em>Punch</em> decidedly hostile to the young Tory
lions who supported that inflexible peer. When in 1900 the Coal Mining
Companies in Fife declared a dividend of 50 per cent., and the price of
coal was still rising, <em>Punch</em> castigated the greed of the owners. In
1907 the miners are exempted from any share of the responsibility for
the high cost of coal. The triple Cerberus who dominates the situation
is made up of the colliery owner, the coal merchant and the railway
company. But as the price this joint monster exacted was only 30s. a
ton&mdash;exorbitant for the time, no doubt&mdash;it is hard for this generation
to share <em>Punch's</em> sympathy for the consumer. As late as 1912, when the
coal crisis again became acute, <em>Punch</em>, though resenting the increased
resort to the strike weapon, represents the merchant profiteer as in
clover while Britannia is the victim of his avarice.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Underpaid Women Workers</em></div>

<p>On behalf of <em>unorganized</em> labour, when it was unfairly exploited by
the employer, <em>Punch</em> continued to lift up his voice in the old strain.
In 1893 the hard case of the shopgirls, slave-driven by exacting
masters, always standing, too tired at the end of the week to profit
by Sunday, prompts him to a plea for a true Day of Rest. The verses,
like the "Cry of the City Clerk," are vitiated by their sentimentality.
There is more vigour in the lines "'Arriet on Labour" in the same year,
which show that the new type of woman was not confined to the upper
classes. 'Arriet is a workgirl who works hard, loves her freedom and
nights off, has no respect for spouting Labour candidates, and no envy
of married drudges:&mdash;</p>

<p>Another "hard case" exposed by <em>Punch</em> in the following year was that
of the rural schoolmistress, contrasted unfavourably with Crabbe's
version. <em>Punch</em> took his cue from a paper read by Dr. Macnamara at
a meeting of the N.U.T. and drew a lamentable picture of the weary,
overworked and miserably underpaid teacher, "passing <em>poor</em> on £40 a
year." The picture was obviously drawn at second-hand, but the line in
which the schoolmistress is described as "a lonely, tired, certificated
slave" was an excellent summary of a real hardship. Women workers were
not only slave-driven by employers and underpaid by the State; they
were also handicapped by the competition of their sisters who only
worked for pocket-money. This, at least, was the burden of a complaint
made by an old-fashioned woman in the <em>Daily Chronicle</em> in the autumn
of 1895:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In every branch of work we see well-to-do women crowding into the
ranks of competition, in consequence of which wages are lowered, and
women who really want work are left to starve."</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter inspired <em>Punch</em> to deliver a fierce homily in verse on
the wickedness of well-to-do women "playing at work," to the detriment
of their poor sisters. As a set-off, however, we may note that in 1897
<em>Punch</em> condemns mistresses for exploiting "Lady servants," getting
them to do double the work for half the ordinary wages because of their
inability to stand up for themselves. Sweated women workers were still
to be found in the tailoring trade, and <em>Punch</em> did well in 1896 to
retell in his columns the story of the tailoress, Mary Ould of Peckham,
as unfolded before the Lambeth County Court. She had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> buy her own
materials and pay her fare for fetching and carrying work; she toiled
till 10 p.m. from Saturday till Thursday and, at ¾d. per coat, earned
3s. The pillorying of these abuses did credit to <em>Punch's</em> humanity,
but as they were nearly always chosen from unorganized trades, they
became increasingly difficult to reconcile with his increasing
hostility to trade union organization, and his distrust of legislation
expressly designed to satisfy the demands of Labour. Philanthropic
efforts to relieve the squalor of the home life of the poor were
another matter. To the appeals of the Children's Country Holiday Fund
<em>Punch</em> always lent a ready ear, and when Canon Barnett arranged an
exhibition of Watts's pictures in Whitechapel, <em>Punch</em> vigorously
applauded the scheme. Pictures were as good as sermons, and better than
many:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w36"><div class="stanza">

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Children's Champion</em></div>

<p>At the same time the Philistine attitude of the East End matron is not
overlooked in Phil May's picture. Much depended on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> the spirit in which
this campaign of enlightenment was conducted, and <em>Punch</em> continued to
rebuke and satirize the lack of sympathy and comprehension shown by the
fashionable "slummer." He had "no use" for people like "Mrs. Slumley
Smirk," the District Visitor, who asked to be warned if any illness was
about, as then she wouldn't wish to come near; and he was even more
satirical at the expense of Socialism as conceived by certain members
of the aristocracy&mdash;<em>vide</em> the imaginary interview with "Lady Yorick"
in 1905&mdash;who sought to have it both ways, and, as I notice elsewhere,
represented a new and inverted type of snobbery.</p>

<p>For the scandal of the insurance of poor children's lives he held not
the parents, but the "Bogus Insurance sneak," mainly responsible. He
is at least half in sympathy with the soliloquy in St. James's Park of
the Socialist loafer who deprecates the amount of food wasted on the
ducks and swans. He applauds the revival of Folk Dancing in 1903; in
1905 there is a long and charming sketch of an old Cambridge bedmaker
who had recently died at an advanced age; and in the following year
<em>Punch</em> published a delightful imaginary description of a socialistic
experiment, by which poor children were sent on visits to "upper-class"
families, and treated as guests and equals, to the mutual profit of
both classes. The scheme is suggested as an improvement on bazaars
and similar activities. On the other hand, <em>Punch</em> indulges in ironic
comment on the result of well-meant efforts to teach poor children to
"think imperially"&mdash;a subject on which he spoke with more than one
voice. In an Empire Day Essay a London school-child wrote in 1908:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"There are a lot of Empires like Chinese Empire, Hackney Empire,
Stratford Empire, and Russian Empire. Hackney Empire is different to
ours because they sing there, and ours is places."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Boy Scout Movement</em></div>

<p>The best-inspired and most fruitful of all movements for the uplifting
of the children of the people which belongs to this period was that
of the Boy Scouts. It was entirely independent of State or official
encouragement, and sprang from the ingenious brain of one man, General
Sir Robert Baden-Powell, and <em>Punch</em>, as an Individualist, was not
inclined to think worse of it on that account. As a matter of fact, he
greeted the Boy Scouts with the utmost cordiality from the very outset.
In 1909 his cartoon on "Our Youngest Line of Defence" shows the Boy
Scout reassuring Mrs. Britannia: "Fear not, Grandma; no danger can
befall you now. Remember <em>I</em> am with you." Later on in 1911 came the
delightful cartoon of the Boy Scouts capturing Windsor Castle, and, on
the very eve of the war, in <em>Punch's</em> Holiday Pages we encounter the
late Mr. F. H. Townsend's admirable picture of our "dear old friend the
foreign spy (cunningly disguised as a golfer) visiting our youngest
suburb on a Saturday afternoon in quest of further evidence of our
lethargy, general decadence and falling birth-rate." As a result of
observing the activity and numbers of the Boy Scouts, he gets a serious
shock, and at once telegraphs to his Commander-in-Chief "urging that
the conquest of the British Isles be undertaken before the present
generation is many years older." This oblique and imaginative tribute
was happily conceived and well deserved. The spirit of the Boy Scout
movement was at least a contributory factor in helping us to win the
War. What was even more important was the conversion of a great many
Pacificists from their mistrust of the alleged "militarism" of the
movement, and their recognition of its essential value as an instrument
in fostering self-respect, truthfulness, altruistic kindliness and
cleanliness of mind and body.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Strikes and Unemployment</em></div>

<p>This record&mdash;and it is by no means exhaustive&mdash;of <em>Punch's</em>
humanitarian activities must not blind us to the fact that throughout
these years the principal object of his sympathy and compassion was
not the working man but the middle-class tax-and rate-payer. In 1893
<em>Punch</em> depicts him bound to a post and in danger of being drowned by
the rising tide of rates&mdash;L.C.C., Asylums, Libraries, Baths, Vestries.
<em>Punch</em>, as we have seen, did not acquit the coal owners and coal
merchants of rapacity, but he was not any more sympathetic to the
miners&mdash;witness the following dialogue printed in the same year:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">THE STRIKER'S VADE MECUM</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Question.</em> You think it is a good thing to strike?</p>

<p><em>Answer.</em> Yes, when there is no other remedy.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Is there ever any other remedy?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Never. At least, so say the secretaries.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Then you stand by the opinions of the officials?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Why, of course; because they are paid to give them.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But have not the employers any interests?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Lots, but they are not worthy the working man's consideration.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But are not their interests yours?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes, and that is the way we guard over them.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But surely it is the case of cutting off the nose to spite the
mouth?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> And why not, if the mouth is too well fed.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But are not arguments better than bludgeons?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No. And bludgeons are less effective than revolvers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But may not the use of revolvers produce the military?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes, but they can do nothing without a magistrate reading the
Riot Act.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But, the Riot Act read, does not the work become serious?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Probably. But at any rate the work is lawful, because
unremunerative.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But how are the wives and children of strikers to live if their
husbands and fathers earn no wages?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> On strike money.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But does all the strike money go to the maintenance of the hearth
and home?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Of course not, for a good share of it is wanted for the
baccy-shop and the public-house.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But if strikes continue will not trade suffer?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Very likely, but trade represents the masters.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> And if trade is driven away from the country, will it come back?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Most likely not, but that is a matter for the future.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But is not the future of equal importance to the present?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Not at all, for a day's thought is quite enough for a day's work.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Then a strike represents either nothing or idleness?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes, bludgeons or beer.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> And what is the value of reason?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Why, something less than smoke.</p></blockquote>

<p>Simultaneously <em>Punch</em> published a cartoon (rather prematurely) in
which Mars, expressing his readiness to arbitrate, appeals to Vulcan to
do the same. Lord Rosebery's successful intervention as a mediator in
the coal strike in December, 1893, is handsomely acknowledged in the
cartoon in which he figures as the "G.O.M.'s handy boy." Lord Rosebery
was still at the height of his personal popularity; it was not until
1905 that <em>Punch</em> described him as "unemployable." Unemployment had
reached formidable dimensions, and then, as now, proved serviceable
material to the political agitator. Mr. Asquith, as Home Secretary,
had allowed political meetings in Trafalgar Square "so long as the
proceedings were orderly," and <em>Punch</em> represented the disappointment
of the extremists at having the ground cut from under their feet by
this condition. A year later <em>Punch</em> depicted the Trafalgar Square of
the future, with anarchy rampant in every corner, and early in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> 1894
the verses "The Devil's Latest Walk (after Coleridge and Southey),"
fiercely attacking Socialist agitators as animated by sheer malice, are
accompanied by a picture of a fiendish figure with horns and tail.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Gambling and Improvidence</em></div>

<p>It was about this time that, as we read in the <em>Annual Register</em>, "a
large body of the unemployed attended service at St. Paul's Cathedral
in response to an invitation from Canon Scott Holland, whose sermon
was frequently interrupted by the applause of those present." <em>Punch</em>,
in his then mood, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> have probably explained this episode on the
principle of "the Devil was sick, the Devil a monk would be." <em>Punch</em>
was no admirer of the art of Mr. George Moore, but he had paid him
reluctant homage as a moralist in 1894, under the head of "All the
Winners":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Boycotted or not boycotted, if <em>Esther Waters</em> calls general and
effectual attention to the growth of gambling, which is the real
"curse of the country" in these days, it will do more good than all
the <em>Dodos</em> and <em>Marcellas</em> and <em>Barabbases</em> and <em>Heavenly Twins</em> in
all the Libraries in the land.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was in the same spirit that a few years later <em>Punch</em> applauded
the idea of establishing a Bureau of Common-sense to combat the
extravagance and improvidence of the working classes. The suggestion
was made by Judge Emden, the well-known County Court Judge, in dealing
with the case of a man who, on wages of from 25s. to 30s. a week,
committed himself to a twenty-five-guinea piano on the hire-purchase
system.</p>

<p>"Agricultural Depression" bulks largely in <em>Punch's</em> pages in the
'nineties, but it is the farmer, not the farm labourer, who is singled
out for commiseration. In 1893 he is shown as Buridan's Ass between two
piles of sapless chaff&mdash;Tory and Liberal&mdash;overburdened by the triple
load of Rents, Rates and Foreign Competition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

<p>In the summer of 1894 the verses "A Good Time Coming" foreshadow the
end of the agricultural depression, but a few weeks later the farmer
was bitterly disappointed. His crops had been plentiful, but the plenty
had brought down the price of wheat in some cases to 16s. and 19s. a
quarter. In short, there had been a golden harvest, but he couldn't
get gold for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> it. Let it be noted, in parenthesis, that if <em>Punch</em>
espoused the cause of the farmer, he was not wholly wedded to the
old rural <em>régime</em> of the Squire and the Parson. In 1894 there is a
humorously ironic lament by a lover of the "Good Old Times" in the form
of a new version of "The Village Blacksmith," suggested by the actual
return of a blacksmith to one of the new parish councils at the head
of the poll. When the Conservatives came back to power in 1895, Lord
Salisbury, in a new fable of Hercules and the Farmer, is represented
as adroitly ascribing agricultural depression to Providence, and
exculpating the Government which had done its best; but the farmer is
unconvinced by this pious explanation. The remedy which the Government
sought to apply in the Agricultural Land Rating Bill of 1896 failed
to satisfy <em>Punch</em>. Mr. Chaplin is seen, in an adaptation of Æsop,
shifting the burden of rural rates from the horse (country) to the
ass (town). But the latter was <em>Punch's</em> special <em>protégé</em>, and the
verses in May express accurately enough the cry of the poor townsman,
the rate-crushed cockney, protesting against Mr. Chaplin's remedy when
the income-tax was already 8d. in the pound! The income-tax payer this
time is the patient ass, hoping that some at least of the surplus of
six millions may be devoted to the relief of his gigantic burden.
To return to Agriculture, a sidelight is thrown on the shortage of
farm hands in 1901, in the picture of an elderly farmer rebuking a
very small boy for slacking, only to be met by the retort "Chaps is
scarce." The parallel to the Great War is obvious, but one would hardly
have thought that the Boer war was on a large enough scale to affect
the labour market in this way. In 1903 voluntary labour bureaus were
started, but the results were disappointing, and <em>Punch</em> quotes an
account of an experiment in Wiltshire. Fifteen men had been sent down
from London; two returned in three days "because it rained"; and twelve
more were back in a fortnight. Our increasing reliance on imported food
had already prompted <em>Punch</em> to indulge in a forecast of the Stores
of the Future, at which Tierra-del-Fuego Devonshire cream and similar
products are offered for sale because it had become impossible to get
any home-grown produce. The exodus from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> the land to the cities was
already in full swing, and we find <em>Punch</em> as early as 1896 commending
a clergyman who had started dancing classes in his village near Stroud
as a counter-attraction to the lure of the towns. In this context it
is worthy of note that in 1900 <em>Punch</em> suggested that, as a result of
socialistic legislation in Australia and elsewhere, and the growing
struggle for the good things of life, no one was willing "to do the
washing up." Yet prices and taxes were low enough to excite the envy of
the harassed post-war householder. Eggs were advertised at 16 for 1s.,
but even this did not satisfy Phil May's broken-down tragedian in 1900,
who exclaims as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> he reads the announcement in a shop-window: "Cheap!
Ha! Ha! Why, in my time they <em>threw</em> them at us."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Town v. Country</em></div>

<p>If all was not well with those who lived on or by the land, the town
exodus of week-enders and the demand for small country residences had
already created a cult of "rural felicity," the artificiality of which
did not escape <em>Punch</em> when he satirized in 1904 the platitudinous
appreciation of Nature and country life distilled in the halfpenny
Press. At the same time the drastic legislation dealing with the
land problem introduced by the Liberals on their return to power in
1906 found little or no sympathy from <em>Punch</em>. The cross-currents
revealed in the Unionist Party by the great Tariff Reform controversy,
the resignation of Mr. Chamberlain, the secession of the Free Trade
Ministers, and the inability of the plain person to cope with the
transcendental fiscal dialectics of Mr. Balfour, had made it difficult
for <em>Punch</em>, born and bred in the principles of Free Trade, to accord
a whole-hearted support to the Unionist administration in its later
years. There was, however, no perplexity in his attitude towards
the land policy of their successors. At all their stages <em>Punch</em>
was hostile to the new "Lloyd Georgics." We may specially single
out the cartoon in August, 1910, presenting a "study of a free-born
Briton who, within the period usually allotted to his holidays,
is required under threat of a penalty of £50 to answer a mass of
obscure conundrums relating to land values, to facilitate his future
taxation." The miseries of this inquisitorial process are further
developed in an imaginary extract from a specimen return showing how
some of the questions in the historic "Form IV" were to be answered.
The sequel to this laborious and costly preliminary investigation
falls outside the scope of this volume. Nor is it necessary to dwell
at length on the movement, doubtless animated by a noble sympathy
with the rural population, initiated by the <em>Daily Mail</em> in 1911 on
behalf of the revival of windmills and standard bread. The new-found
interest in the yokel is satirized in the song of the "Merry Hind"
(after Masefield's <em>Daffodil Fields</em>), and the cartoon "The Return
of the Golden Age" in February, 1913, where Mr. Lloyd George is seen
emptying a cornucopia of "rare and refreshing fruit"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> into the lap of
the ecstatic farm labourer. Hodge was at last fairly in the limelight,
for both parties had their land policy, and the opening of Mr. Lloyd
George's Land Campaign in October is symbolized by a picture of him as
an irresponsible music-hall comedian with "Songs Without Wurzels. No.
1, Land of Hope (as arranged by the Cabinet)" in his hand. Mr. Asquith
is seen as his accompanist, waiting for the "patter" to finish, and
observing, "This is the part that makes me nervous." But the <em>Pall Mall
Gazette</em>, then edited by the great Mr. Garvin, declared in December
that "whatever can be done to improve the lot of the agriculturist will
have the Opposition's cordial support," and, on the strength of this
assurance, the Premier's anxiety, in <em>Punch's</em> view, was allayed. When
Scout George reports to his chief "the enemy is on our side, sir,"
Scoutmaster Asquith replies, "Then let the battle begin."</p>

<p class="center">THE RETURN OF THE GOLDEN AGE<br />
(Vide The Lloyd-Georgics&mdash;passim)</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Work, Wages, Pensions, and Doles</em></div>

<p>Farmers and farm labourers were regarded in <em>Punch's</em> survey as
not much more than pawns in the game of party politics. The claims
of organized labour in the other great industries and the general
tendency of legislation in their interests found him a more vigilant
and a more hostile critic. Even so mild a measure as the Early Closing
Bill of 1896&mdash;with the principle of which he had been in agreement
in earlier years&mdash;excited his misgivings and prompted a forecast
of increasingly intimate interference with the private life of
householders: the outline of his "Household Regulations Act" contains
provisions for hours of rising, cleaning, meals, bills and rent. It
is a burlesque, but none the less indicates resentment of patriarchal
State interference. Yet <em>Punch's</em> general individualism admitted of
exceptions. He noted the failure of the Voluntary Labour Bureau system,
and was frivolously critical of the amateur attempt of a vicar to start
Trust Houses to supersede Public Houses&mdash;a movement which later on came
to stay and to achieve solid results. Here, however, allowance must
be made for <em>Punch's</em> inveterate distrust of temperance agitators.
State interference on behalf of minorities did not always meet with
<em>Punch's</em> approval, and in 1898 we find him vehemently protesting
against the recognition of "Conscientious Objectors" to vaccination. In
a striking picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> headed "The Triumph of De-Jenner-ation" he shows
a grisly skeleton waving as his banner the Vaccination Bill, which
<em>Punch</em> calls "the Bill for the encouragement of Small Pox." But the
burden of his criticisms of Labour is concerned with the artificial
restriction of output, the conversion of the trade unions from an
industrial to a political organization, and the increasing tendency of
State intervention to encourage a reluctance either to work or save.
The picture of Hyde Park on "Labour Day" in 1898 with the grass strewn
with recumbent sleeping figures is, if I read it aright, designed less
in compassion for the unemployed than as a satire on the unemployable.
Wages were high in the bricklaying trade, but a shortage of labour
was complained of; as for the skill required, a surveyor had written
to the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> stating that "any ordinary man could learn
bricklaying in a fortnight," and <em>Punch</em> ironically foreshadows the
invasion of the trade by underpaid clerks, barristers, etc. Ruskin
College&mdash;opened at Oxford in 1899&mdash;is described as "a College for
Labour Leaders" by <em>Punch</em>, who rather unnecessarily prophesied that
it might become the scene of "strikes"; but the friction which arose
between those who conceived that the function of the college was purely
educational, and those who wished to make it a school of political
thought, went far to justify <em>Punch's</em> misgivings. The plan of Old
Age Pensions had long been in the air. The committee which reported
in 1892 showed considerable divergence of opinion. Mr. Chamberlain,
the chairman, condemned Mr. Charles Booth's proposal of the general
endowment of old age as a gigantic system of outdoor relief for every
one, good and bad, thrifty and unthrifty. The majority of the Royal
Commission of 1893 were adverse to State pensions. The Rothschild
Committee in 1896 found themselves unable to devise any satisfactory
proposal. The Select Committee over which Mr. Chaplin presided put
forward a scheme substantially on Mr. Charles Booth's lines, but
in view of the cost and the hostility of the Government the matter
rested till the passing of the Act by the Liberals in 1908. <em>Punch</em>,
it may be noted, was no enthusiast for the scheme formulated by the
Chaplin Committee; his cartoon of "Old Gaffer" and "Little Chappelin"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
(modelled on Southey's ballad) is undoubtedly hostile, and the
accompanying verses end up on a cynical note when the "Old Gaffer" asks
"Little Chappelin" what is the bag he is carrying, and is told:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Only another dole," said he;</p>
<p class="i0">"It <em>is</em> a famous Ministry."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The Trade Union Congress at Plymouth in the same year censured Lord
Mount Edgcumbe because, in throwing open his grounds to them, he
had reserved the privacy of his lawn for a garden party. <em>Punch</em>
accordingly indulged in some sarcastic verses, supposed to be written
by a Trade Unionist, and ironically applauding the action of Mr. Ben
Tillett, who had distinguished himself by his attack on Lord Mount
Edgcumbe. This was fair game enough, though to-day it would probably
have been passed over in silence. <em>Punch</em> no doubt was thinking of the
saying that an Englishman's house is his castle; and hardly anticipated
the time when an Englishman's or an English nobleman's castle
would cease to be his home. To-day we read with an amused surprise
<em>Punch's</em> comment in 1900 on the introduction of an eight-hours'
day for domestics in Australia, and his forecast of a similar state
of affairs in England under a new Patriarchal Statute. Nor is there
anything wildly extravagant in his ironical anticipation of the cook
of the future demanding £100 wages, though unable to guarantee more in
return than "chop one day and steak the next." The higher education of
servants, according to <em>Punch</em>, was tending to produce a type which
knew everything except the things which really mattered. He tells us in
1902 of a lady who was delighted to get a cook who could develop her
photographs, and gives us, in the same year, an excellent study (after
Gilbert) of the "Up-to-date Cook-General":&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Aristocrats of Labour</em></div>

<p>The plethora of processions in 1901 moved <em>Punch</em> to make various
suggestions for the better conduct of such spectacles, mostly in the
shape of fantastic and satirical concessions to the greatest happiness
of the greatest number of sightseers. Warnings against the <em>panem
et circenses</em> habit were legitimate enough, but <em>Punch</em> took a more
aggressive line in his attack on the miners in 1901:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">A BLACK LOOK-OUT</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">(A paper picked up near the office of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.)</p>

<p>Pity the sorrows of a poor collier, who, if a shilling export duty is
imposed upon coal, will have (possibly) to see&mdash;</p>

<p>1. His wife giving up her music and riding lessons.</p>

<p>2. His children not able to go to the seaside for a month or two.</p>

<p>3. His favourite licensed victualler unable to supply him with that
extra quart he enjoys so much after he has drunk the others.</p>

<p>4. His dogs unable to compete for prizes because their upkeep will be
too expensive.</p>

<p>5. His tailor sending in his account and respectfully requesting
immediate payment.</p>

<p>6. His wine merchant writing to ask him why he has given up ordering
champagne.</p>

<p>7. Worst (and, fortunately, most improbable) of all, himself having to
work four days a week instead of three.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>In earlier years <em>Punch</em> would have given chapter and verse for such
charges; the later method, though it makes easier reading, carries
less weight. <em>Punch</em> did not, however, wholly abandon the practice of
"documenting" his criticism, and he turned it to excellent account in
a discussion of the much-abused German clerk in 1898, when he quoted
the following passage from the official Consular Report from Stettin,
issued by the Foreign Office:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Much of the commercial knowledge of Germany has been supplied by young
Germans who have been employed as clerks in Great Britain, mostly
as foreign correspondents. British clerks cannot be used as foreign
correspondents, because not one in a thousand can correspond correctly
in any foreign language.</p></blockquote>

<p>For the effective German competition which threatened to oust British
trade from the markets of the world, <em>Punch</em> did not hold any one class
responsible. The fault was our national complacency, symbolized in 1901
by a lethargic John Bull priding himself on the superior excellence of
his goods, but declining to take the trouble to make foreign customers
understand it. The contrast between the German and the Briton in regard
to practical business capacity is brought out in the papers headed,
"Pashley's Opinions." "Efficiency" was the motto of the hour, yet
<em>Punch</em> found it hard to reconcile the cry with the "Catchwords for
the Million," especially the "Equal Rights of Man" as interpreted by
trade union rules, especially those affecting bricklaying, which in his
view sterilized competition and ambition. Another side of the subject
is dealt with in the series of papers entitled, "How to get on," one
of which satirizes the almost hysterical worship of "efficiency"
by those who in the same breath declared that we were the greatest
race on earth and also the greatest slackers, but confined their own
energies to mere talk. The underlying principles, however, which
govern <em>Punch's</em> contributions to the "Efficiency" controversy could
not be better summed up than in the dictum of Mr. J. M. Beck,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">[5]</a> the

<div class="sidenote"><em>Sport and Crime</em></div>

<p>What troubled <em>Punch</em>, to borrow an epigram from another American
anonymous writer, was "not so much the unemployment of the idle as
the idleness of the employed." He is increasingly concerned with the
popular pre-occupation with sport and criminal celebrities, combined
with a corresponding apathy on important questions. Foreign politics
were only brought home to the masses when they lent themselves to
sensational or spectacular treatment, and, in 1903, <em>Punch</em> gibbets an
announcement in the <em>Scotsman</em>: "Scenes resulting from the Macedonian
Atrocities displayed by the Modern Marvel Cinematograph, at 3 and 8
(see Amusement Column)." The sentimental interest in criminals is
bluntly rebuked as a perversion of the philanthropic maxim that "to
know all is to forgive all"; the blame for this was attributed to the
journals which catered for the million, but the avidity with which
this pabulum was devoured, and the absence of any protest from those
affected, was a disquieting symptom; and <em>Punch</em> was within his rights
in making game of the <em>Clarion</em> when it scented class distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> in
the abortive movement to introduce knee-breeches for evening wear.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Liberals and Labour</em></div>

<p>In the Unionist defeat at the election of 1906, <em>Punch</em> recognized not
merely the return to power of the Liberals, but the coming of the "New
Demos," the growing importance of the Labour Party, and the increasing
impetus lent to its demands. His "farewell to the beaten side" is
animated by no enthusiasm for the victors:&mdash;</p>

<p>The prophecy that the Liberals would invoke the assistance of the
Unionists to "save them from their friends" was not fulfilled; the
course of legislation up to the war indicated in the main a desire
to consult the demands of Labour rather than to break away from the
alliance. The summary of reasons "Why I lost" from defeated candidates
furnishes a useful commentary on the verses quoted above. They include
Chinese Labour, the Big Loaf cry, the Education Bill of 1902, the Trade
Disputes Bill, Overbridge Trams, the Japanese Alliance and the <em>Entente
Cordiale</em>. The messages were not actually received by <em>Punch</em>, but they
are not an unfair interpretation of the issues which weighed with the
bulk of the electorate. A "spirited foreign policy" was out of favour,
and a cold fit had succeeded to the fervour of the "Khaki" election.</p>

<p>The Government lost no time in setting to work to redeem their pledge
about Trade Disputes. Early in April, C.-B. figures in the cartoon
"Hard to please" as a farmer soliloquizing over his dog (Labour),
"He's had two platefuls of biscuits and isn't satisfied. Looks as if
he wanted raw meat." The plates, labelled Workmen's Compensation and
Merchant Shipping Bill, are both empty. The third, the Trade Disputes
Bill, is full of biscuits as yet untouched. When the Attorney-General,
Sir J. Lawson Walton, introduced that measure, <em>Punch</em>, in his "Essence
of Parliament," speaks of it as a "ticklish Bill" conceding important
demands in regard to picketing and conspiracy, but "as to the immunity
of Trade Union funds from amercement consequent on civil actions,
the Bill does not go the full lengths of the demands of Labour." The
attitude of the Labour Party, who threatened to bring in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> their own
Bill and to insist on its substitution for the Government measure,
is symbolized in the cartoon showing Labour offering <em>his</em> scales
to Justice in preference to her own, in which Capital and Labour
are equally balanced, with the comment, "I think you'll find <em>this</em>
pair works better&mdash;for me." The climbing down of the Government in
the autumn session is illustrated in a further cartoon representing
Labour as the predominant partner. The Liberal Party is seen on foot
being pushed on by a donkey (Labour) drawing a cart in which the Trade
Disputes Bill is sitting. "Yes," says the old lady, "I was wrong to
threaten him with a whip. The dear creature must be led, not driven.
Still&mdash;this isn't quite the way I meant to come." Comment in <em>Punch's</em>
"Essence of Parliament" on the progress of the Bill is curiously
meagre, but there is one illuminating paragraph on the Report Stage:
"The Attorney-General explained that when at the earlier stage he
argued against the immunity of Trade Unions from action at law, he did
not mean to debar himself from subsequently insisting upon the justice
of such immunity." The momentous and far-reaching consequences of a
measure which created a privileged class and set them above the law
were only dimly apprehended in <em>Punch</em>, who confined himself in his
further comments to the lack of spirit shown by the Opposition in the
Lords. Thus in "The Better Part of Valour" we see the Trade Disputes
Bill standing over the prostrate figure of the Education Bill, about to
batter its way into the Lords, while Lord Lansdowne remarks: "<em>I</em> bar
your way? My dear fellow! Why, you've got a mandate." "Well, so had my
friend here," rejoins the T.D.B., on which Lord Lansdowne replies: "Ah!
but not such a big one!" The same idea is developed in the Epilogue,
where the Lords are charged by the representative of "The People's
Will" with having attacked and brutally ill-treated the Education Bill,
while they were too cowardly to tackle the Trade Disputes Bill.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Revolt of the Middle Classes</em></div>

<p>The <em>Daily Mail</em>, which had anticipated a Unionist victory at the
polls, now espoused the cause of the "Middle-Class Serf," taxed
and rated and bled beyond endurance "in the interests of the most
pampered section of the community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> the labouring man," and rumours
of the formation of a new political body, with a view to obtaining
justice and recognition, impelled <em>Punch</em> to indulge in a forecast,
half sympathetic, half sceptical, of "The Turning of the Middle-Class
Worm":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w30"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">England, be warned! The time for patience passes;</p>

<p class="i0">Worn to a thread by Labour's licensed plunder</p>

<p class="i0">Can anybody reasonably wonder</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>In 1897 <em>Punch</em> had resented Government interference with the
management of workhouses, and fell foul of the Local Government Board
when a Board of Guardians in Lincolnshire were asked to make a return
of the number of currants put into the children's puddings. Ten years
later the ground of this complaint had shifted; and the administrative
scandals which <em>Punch</em> assails in 1907 are ascribed to the extravagance
of Labour Guardians. Poplar is described as "the Pauper's Paradise";
and the new Bumbledom is shown, in a perversion of the scene from
"Oliver Twist," "asking for more," while the miserable ratepayer ladles
out champagne-cup for its refreshment. The "latest excursion" is "A day
in Profuse Poplar," the lair of the "Gorgeous Guardians."</p>

<p>The Workmen's Compensation Act is treated as a set-off to the
Prevention of Corruption Act, aimed at the abuse of secret commissions,
and a butler is shown reassuring a cook and advising her how to get her
own back by a carefully contrived accident. The same spirit is revealed
in the picture of the workman whose innocence has been outraged by
someone who said he had seen him hurry: "I <em>never</em> 'urry."</p>

<p>To this year belongs the farcical suggestion of a Society to Protect
Employers, for the special benefit of persons who were afraid of their
servants and had not the courage to dismiss them.</p>

<p><em>Punch</em> was nearer the mark in his illustrations of the popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
prejudice against the Army. A football enthusiast at a match
commiserates "silly people who mess about with a rifle on Saturday
afternoons"; and a "Spartan mother" standing at a barrack gate,
uplifts her voice in thankfulness that her Bill "isn't wasting his
time drilling," while Bill is shown in an inset engrossed in the
contemplation of a pot of beer.</p>

<p><em>Punch</em> distrusted Socialism because, in his view, it led in practice
to vicarious generosity. The Socialist would give half of everything,
so long as he didn't possess it himself. Yet in apportioning the
blame for the railway trouble in 1907, <em>Punch</em> did not spare Capital.
Railway directors and trade unions were in his cartoon shown as equally
animated by a disregard for the interests of the public. Incidentally
we may note that the volunteer service rendered by the general public
in 1919 is anticipated in a humorous sketch of the experiences of an
amateur porter. <em>Punch</em>, even where he felt strongly, was alive to the
extravagances of the extremists on his own side, witness the verses
in 1908 which purport to express the perplexity of "an open-minded
beggar":&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Punch's</em> comment on the Eight Hours Bill is influenced by the
objections of those who opposed it on the ground that it would affect
the cost of all the necessaries of life. King Coal observes, "This
means that I shall have to reduce my output," and Commerce rejoins,
"Then I shall have to reduce mine, too," and both agree in doubting
whether the Government had ever thought of this inevitable result.</p>

<p>Old Age Pensions are shown in 1908 as having already become a millstone
round the neck of the Government; and in that form Mr. Asquith is seen
tying them to the person of Mr. Lloyd George as a presentation to be
worn by all Chancellors of the Exchequer in perpetuity. "Several of our
contemporaries," <em>Punch</em> observes, "are devoting their columns to an
explanation of the best way to obtain an Old Age Pension. <em>Mr. Punch's</em>
advice is: <em>Don't save</em>."</p>

<p>On the much-vexed question of Chinese Labour, <em>Punch</em> sided
against its critics, and his cartoons in 1906 represent Sir Henry
Campbell-Bannerman forcing unwelcome freedom on the Chinese coolie.
Ignorance of Imperial questions on the part of the Labour Party is
a frequent theme of comment. In the same year we find an article
describing an imaginary tour in the Colonies by Mr. Keir Hardie and
Mr. Philip Snowden. Mr. Keir Hardie spent two months in India in
1907, and the reports of his speeches, which he declared to be gross
exaggerations and fabrications, led to vehement protests in the British
Press. His biographer states that "for a full fortnight Keir Hardie
was the most violently detested man throughout the English-speaking
world. Even <em>Punch</em> joined in the vituperation with a cartoon by Linley
Sambourne, which showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> Britannia gripping the agitator by the scruff
of the neck and apostrophizing him: 'Here, you'd better come home.
We know all about you there, and you'll do less harm.'" <em>Punch's</em>
adverse comments were not merely pictorial, and though Mr. Keir Hardie
laid himself open to criticism by his angularity, his vanity and such
remarks as "India to-day is governed by a huge military oligarchy," his
courage and sincerity passed unrecognized.</p>

<p>Strikes and trade depression furnish themes for comment in 1908. In one
cartoon Trade is shown as a lean and ill-favoured goose that has lost
confidence in herself; in another, an engineer going back to work after
seven months' stoppage, meets a cotton-spinning girl just coming out,
and is credited with the admission that his action has done no good to
himself or anyone else.</p>

<p>In 1909-1910 the conflict between Lords and Commons over the Budget
proposals overshadowed all other home issues. It even became a subject
of debate at preparatory schools, and <em>Punch</em> quotes a <em>bonâ fide</em>
letter from a boy of nine: "We had two debates yesterday about the
Budget being rejected. I was against the Budget, but the ones who were
for it won, because just about half the ones who were against it had to
go away for their prayers." Mr. Lloyd George was now the champion and
hero of the democracy, for this was the year of the famous Limehouse
speech and its sequel at Newcastle, where he referred to the House of
Lords as "500 ordinary men, chosen accidentally from the unemployed."
Dukes were handled almost as roughly as by <em>Punch</em> in the 'forties,
and "robber-barons" were held up to obloquy. <em>Punch</em> resented this
wholesale vituperation, and indulged in some effective reprisals in his
criticism of trade union indiscipline, notably the growing tendency
towards unofficial and lightning strikes. Thus, in 1910, he published
a cartoon showing a trade union official lying prostrate in the road,
overthrown and left behind by a crowd marching under a banner inscribed
"Down with Authority." The comments on the payment of Members in the
same year imply that trade unions were hostile to a change which
impaired their control. The State might pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> M.P.s, but the trade
unions must call the tune. Nor was <em>Punch</em> favourably impressed by the
Government's scheme of Insurance against Unemployment, which, in his
forecast, would only encourage the existing reluctance to work.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Claims for "Recognition"</em></div>

<p>Throughout 1911 and 1912 the claims of the new Trade Unionism met
with little sympathy. "Look here, my friend," says John Bull of the
"New Volunteer Police" to a Trade Union leader: "I've been hearing a
good deal of talk of 'recognition.' Well, I represent the public, and
it's about time <em>my</em> interests were 'recognized.'" A month later, in
October, 1911, an "imported agitator" is shown talking to his comrade
as they watch the President of the Board of Trade (Mr. Sydney Buxton)
nailing up a notice of the new Government Conciliation Scheme, with
Sir George Askwith as chairman of the Industrial Council. "Don't be
down-hearted," he observes. "Let's hope we shall be able to make as
much trouble as before." This was apportioning the responsibility for
failure in advance; but unfortunately failure there was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> <em>Punch's</em>
frontispiece to 1912 is the "tug of war" of Labour and Capital. The
coal crisis was again acute in February, but in its opening stages
<em>Punch's</em> hostility was chiefly displayed against the coal merchant,
who was against strikes, but the more they were threatened the better
it suited his book. <em>Punch</em> derived a certain malicious satisfaction
from the spectacle of Mr. Ramsay MacDonald's exclusion from the coal
conference; but recognized that the final arbiter was not this or that
leader or statesman but Famine. The thorny question of "blackleg"
labour having again emerged, <em>Punch</em> asserted the right of the
community in no uncertain terms. John Bull declares that he can't make
the <em>striker</em> work, if he won't; but if others want to, he can and will
make the striker let them. This strike introduced a new figure into
<em>Punch's</em> portrait gallery; "Prince Petroleo" being introduced for the
first time as a possible "second string" and rival of the hitherto
indispensable King Coal. But such light-hearted treatment is henceforth
rarely found in the treatment of industrial troubles. By the summer
John Bull is seen on the edge of the crater of Labour unrest, listening
vainly for any reassuring voices from its depths. The methods of the
Trade Unionist are contrasted with those of Justice: he is all for
striking first and arguing afterwards. The threat of a general strike
was heard in June, but <em>Punch</em> remained sceptical as to the response.
Agitators might call spirits from the vasty deep; but there would be no
answer. In 1913 Dublin, for the first time in its long and chequered
career, became the chief focus of industrial unrest in the British
Isles, for this was the year of the strike of the Dublin transport
workers, and the emergence, in the person of the notorious Jim Larkin,
of a super-agitator of the most strenuous type. Strange things were
done in the name of Liberty Hall&mdash;his headquarters&mdash;Mr. Birrell's
absenteeism having become chronic, not to say conspicuous. Larkin was
arrested and imprisoned, but released with a rapidity which reduced
the penalty to a farce; and the assaults on the Dublin police during
the strike riots in the winter were sufficiently severe to excuse <em>Mr.
Punch</em> for calling their assailants the "be-labouring classes."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Labour Members in Transition</em></div>

<p>Mr. John Burns's political evolution, since the days when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> <em>Punch</em>
savagely attacked him at the time of the Trafalgar Square riots in
1884, had long removed him from the range of attack on the score of
his revolutionary views. His former associates regarded him as a
renegade; independent observers found in him an energetic and arbitrary
bureaucrat. <em>Punch</em> appreciated his manliness, but could not resist
having an occasional dig at his complacent egotism, and when the
Cabinet was reconstructed early in 1914, there is a picture of him
praising the four new appointments as "excellent choices&mdash;with perhaps
the exception of Samuel, Hobhouse and Masterman"&mdash;in other words, all
but his own.</p>

<p>Towards Labour members of the House of Commons, <em>Punch</em>, as we have
seen, had of recent years been none too friendly: least of all to
Mr. Keir Hardie. But on the occasion of the debate in the House
over the resignations at the Curragh in March, 1914, <em>Punch's</em>
Parliamentary representative credits them with intervening effectually
as representatives of the vast social and political weight behind
them. In particular he praises Mr. John Ward and Mr. J. H. Thomas for
their warning against militarism. "General Gough may feel keenly the
Ulster situation. Tommy Atkins will feel not less keenly the industrial
situation." For Mr. Thomas went on to point out that in the following
November four hundred thousand railwaymen would come to grips with
their employers, and if they did not attain satisfactory terms they
might simultaneously strike. And if the Opposition doctrine in regard
to Ulster were sound, added Mr. Thomas, "it will be my duty to tell
the railwaymen to prepare for the worst by organizing their forces,
the half-million capital possessed by the Union to be used to provide
arms and ammunition for them." Mr. Thomas still occasionally utters
blood-curdling warnings, but is now the special <em>bête noire</em>, to put
it mildly, of the Labour extremists. General Gough's views on Ulster
and Ireland have undergone considerable modifications, and Mr. John
Ward, who denounced military juntas, is Colonel John Ward, D.S.O., the
gallant soldier, fearlessly candid friend of Labour and uncompromising
foe of Bolshevism.</p>

<h2><a name="EDUCATION_AND_THE_CHURCHES" id="EDUCATION_AND_THE_CHURCHES">EDUCATION AND THE CHURCHES</a></h2>

<p>The passing of the old order in Education had for its chief landmark
the Act of 1871, but the change admits of endless illustrations.
Many of these lie outside the scope of our survey; but no treatise
on the Modern Child would be complete which did not take account
of <em>Punch's</em> contributions to this engrossing problem. To take one
example, the precocious representatives of the "younger generation" in
Leech's pictures are almost invariably shown as the "sedulous apes"
of their elders as men of the world. In the period under review in
this volume imitation gives place to independence. The precocious
child of both sexes&mdash;Leech's precocious children were almost without
exception boys&mdash;is sometimes pedantic, but the distinctive note is
one of scepticism and revolt. The young iconoclast has "found out all
about Santa Claus and is now going to look into this Robinson Crusoe
business." When the Rector asks Molly would she rather be beautiful or
good, Molly audaciously replies: "I'd rather be beautiful and repent."
Another version of the same retort is illustrated in Mr. Shepperson's
charming picture. And when Uncle George, shocked by his little
niece's declaration that she hated all her lessons, asks appealingly,
"Come, now, you don't mean to say you hate history?" he receives the
blunt answer: "Yes, I do. To tell you the truth, Uncle, I don't care
a bit what anybody ever did." In this magnificent declaration of
independence <em>Punch</em> sought to reduce to an absurdity the new doctrine
of "self-expression" as adopted by the nursery. <em>Punch's</em> love of
children was beyond question, but he remained in substantial accord
with the Greek sage who said that the roots of education were bitter
but the fruit sweet; that to avoid or evade the discipline of parents
and teachers was to forgo learning and virtue. The modern and already
fashionable inversion of the old method, by which education was to be
"brightened" and sweetened at the outset, and every study turned into
a game, seemed to <em>Punch</em> subversive of what was not merely an old but
an inevitable order, and the new science of psychological "Pædology"
found in him an invariably hostile critic. Passing over a burlesque
article on the "Scientific Investigation of Infancy" based on a paper
in the <em>Fortnightly</em> in 1895, I may note the first of his rejoinders
to those austere educationists who have made war on Wonderland. In
that year Mr. Holman, an inspector of schools, in an address delivered
before the College of Preceptors, declared that "the race has outgrown
fairy-tales, and to use them for early education is practically to
bring about a reversion to type. They express the ideas of a profoundly
ignorant primitive man. The hero has more often than not to lie, steal
and cheat and to be an ingrate to accomplish his ends." A mass meeting
of fairy-tale heroes and heroines, convoked by <em>Punch</em>, carried by
acclamation a resolution of protest against this heresy, which, by
the way, has of late years been espoused by the redoubtable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> Madame
Montessori. <em>Punch</em> carried the war into the enemy's camp in a revised
version of <em>Cinderella</em>, rewritten so as to combine instruction with
amusement, and based on the latest scientific, ethnological, and
psychological discoveries and theories; while in "New Lamps for Old"
he retold other nursery tales so as to meet the supposed requirements
of the modern child. I am afraid it must be taken as a confession of
the failure of his efforts that in 1911 <em>Punch</em> described an "advanced
child" replying to his grandmother's offer to tell him a story, "Oh,
no, Granny, not a <em>story</em>, please! They're so stodgy and unconvincing
and as out-of-date as <em>tunes</em> in music. We should much prefer an
impressionist word-picture or a subtle character-sketch."</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The War on Wonderland</em></div>

<p>The attempt to teach gardening at certain schools in the 'nineties
was "guyed" in the account of a disastrous imaginary experiment&mdash;the
encouragement of Small Holdings for Small Boys at a fashionable
Preparatory School. Here <em>Punch</em> is irresponsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> and reactionary;
but there is point in his criticism of the new-fangled cult of "nature
study," on the ground that even playtime was now made a burden and toil
for children by object lessons. In the same year (1900) the doctrine of
self-expression was proclaimed in strident tones by Mr. Bernard Shaw
in a lecture to the members of the Teachers' Guild of Great Britain.
"Any grown-up person," said the prophet, "guilty of the crime of trying
to form the character of children ought to be drowned. If there is
to be any progress at all, it must be recognized that the children
know better than their teachers." This was almost beyond the reach of
comment or parody, but <em>Punch</em> did his best. Cranks, whether official
or unofficial, he treated with impartial disrespect, and shortly before
falling upon Mr. Shaw he had gibbeted a school inspector who had been
alleged in his report to have penned this immortal sentence:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The lower babies' mental arithmetic leaves much to be desired.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the verses on "Spoilt Parents" in 1901 <em>Punch</em> expresses an
obviously ironical approval of filial insubordination as encouraged
in America, and a year later took for his text a passage quoted from
an essay written by an Australian girl of thirteen, in which she had
referred to "The Lady of Shalott" as "a fairy tale I remember in my
childhood." In 1903 the activities of the "Pædologist" furnished Punch
with abundant material. He celebrates, again with ironical applause,
the expulsion of Euclid; he refers to an American lady who, in
discussing suitable literature for children, had found a "moral squint"
in <em>Jack and the Beanstalk</em> and <em>Bluebeard</em>; and he founds an excellent
set of verses on an article in the <em>Contemporary</em> by Dr. Woods
Hutchinson. The child, according to this eminent writer, passes through
all the stages of evolution; "he is born not an Anglo-Saxon, but a
Cave-dweller," and <em>Punch</em> proceeds to expound the "recapitulation
theory" as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>As a rule, the most clamorous apostles of the new doctrines hailed
from the New World. In 1904 Mr. G. Archibald, a "Child Specialist" of
Montreal, gave utterance to the now familiar view that "Whenever you
say 'Don't' to a child you crush the creative instinct within him which
is the richest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> most precious thing he has." <em>Punch</em>, it is hardly
necessary to remind the reader, was not likely to subscribe to this
view. Had not the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> referred to his advice to those
about to marry&mdash;<em>Don't</em>&mdash;as "the memorable monosyllabic monition of
the Democritus of Fleet Street"? So we are not surprised to find him
enlarging ironically on the precept of Montreal:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Advancing years failed to reconcile <em>Punch</em> to the non-repressive
method. As late as 1912 one of his artists depicted the chaotic results
in an elementary school of realizing the ideals of one of the pamphlets
of a Teachers' Association, viz., to place a child "in an atmosphere
where there are no restraints, where he can move freely about in the
schoolroom, where the teacher is essentially a passive agent and where
there is no punishment."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Sompting Experiment</em></div>

<p>In this context I may note that about this time <em>Punch</em> frequently
dwells on the unsuitability and extravagant cost of the amusements
provided for children. In "How to Befriend the Gilded Babes" he
castigates without mercy a gentleman who had been writing on
entertainments for titled juveniles, and outlines a children's
party the cost of which is estimated at the modest figure of £250.
<em>Punch's</em> repeated protests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> against the perversion of pantomimes to
suit grown-ups are too familiar to call for detailed mention, but in
connexion with youthful precocity I may mention a curious anticipation
dating from the autumn of 1905. This is a "domestic drama, composed by
an infant of ten summers who, after reaching mature years, retrieved it
from a box containing his toy theatre and copied it out," exactly as
it stood. The drama, which is entitled "The Sheep in Wolf's Clothing,"
bears all the stigmata of a <em>bonâ fide</em> child's essay in dramatic
authorship, and foreshadows the exploits of "Daisy Ashford" without
being either so funny or so vulgar as <em>The Young Visiters</em>. <em>Punch</em> had
always been alive to the educative value of the theatre, and it speaks
well for his vigilance that the remarkable experiment carried out in
the little village of Sompting in Sussex did not escape his notice. The
children were taught by making them act their lessons, and <em>Punch</em> in
some whimsical verses anticipates the extension of the method to the
public schools. It is true that he does not take the experiment quite
seriously, but he does not "crab" it. It was reserved in later years
for a brilliant and enthusiastic educational reformer, Mr. E. G. A.
Holmes, to hail in the Sompting schoolmistress the "Egeria" of the new
<em>régime</em> of elementary instruction. In less benevolent mood <em>Punch</em>
quoted in 1907 an apparently genuine letter which had appeared in the
<em>Children's Realm</em>, a paper which aimed at teaching "the higher way
of living to the young." The letter describes a small boy who was "a
very earnest vegetarian" and a super-prig into the bargain. <em>Punch</em>
was exasperated by prigs in all walks of life, and it rejoiced his
heart when Mr. Roosevelt compared President Wilson to a "Byzantine
logothete." The high-browed infant filled him with dismay, and in
1910 he illustrated the "advance in elementary culture" by a highly
imaginative account of the reply given by a very small boy who had been
asked by a lady visitor whether he enjoyed his recent birthday party:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry</span>: "In the impression retained by the memory, shades have

I save and fix the outline, and it is with my eye on this profiled
distinction that as a critic I speak. It is the function of the critic
to assert with assurance when once his impression has become final;
and it is in noting this circumstance that I perceive how slenderly
prompted I am to deliver myself on such an occasion upon the merits
or attractiveness of the entertainment so generously provided for the
diversion of myself and friends."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Punch's "Universal Hymn"</em></div>

<p>This is an instance of the danger of trying to kill two birds with
one stone, for the parody of Henry James's later manner distracts our
attention from the main aim of the satire. <em>Punch</em> was more sorry for
than annoyed at the children of Chelsea, of ages from five to sixteen,
who were said in 1908 never to ask for Dickens or the <em>Jungle Book</em>
at the Free Library, but to devour works on "science, sociology, fine
arts and religion." In the same year the Sociological Society held an
exhibition of charts and plans, to show parents how to select their
children's toys "as a profound educational agency," but <em>Punch</em> saw in
it nothing but an exhibition of the profoundest Prigmatism&mdash;to use a
word which he coined in later years. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> bitterest comment on the new
spirit of the young belongs to the year 1913, when a boy of seventeen
rebukes his sister of twelve for thanking an old man for picking up her
bag. The best antidote to this spirit was furnished by the Boy Scout
movement, which grafted on to the public-school code of "playing the
game" the larger ideals of altruism and mutual-as opposed to self-help.
I have already spoken of the origin and development of what was the
greatest non-official and informal contribution to national education
of our times. Logically perhaps it ought to have been discussed in this
chapter, but in its wider implications it belongs to the social and
political history of the last twenty years.</p>

<p>To turn from general tendencies to the controversies which arose out
of the working of the Education Act of 1871, we find that <em>Punch</em>
was, as usual, impartially critical of all extremists, whether
clerical or secularist. Against the latter he inveighed in 1894 in his
"Universal Hymn for School Board Hymnals, adapted to modern Educational
requirements":&mdash;</p>

<p>At the close of the same year, however, <em>Punch</em> castigates sectarian
bigots with equal vigour. He took for his text a letter by Dr. James
Martineau to <em>The Times</em>, in which that "wise and gentle teacher"
had appealed to the conflicting parties of School Board electors and
members to reconcile themselves to a peaceful co-existence on the basis
of our common Christianity. <em>Punch</em> does not spare "secular spleen" and
"shortsighted super-thrift," but his severest criticisms are reserved
for the sectarian zealots, Anglican and Nonconformist, who had broken
up the compromise of 1871, and he concludes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Abortive Bill of 1896</em></div>

<p><em>Punch's</em> comments foreshadowed the conflict that raged over the
Education Bill of 1896, which had been framed to redeem the pledge
given by the Government to aid voluntary schools. Denounced by the
Opposition as a deliberate attempt to shatter the school-board system
and promote the interest of a particular sect, while, on the other
hand, all sects were agreed that the proposed aid was inadequate;
swamped by amendments&mdash;1,238, to be precise, had been placed on the
paper when the House met in June after the Whitsuntide Recess&mdash;the
Bill was abandoned in Committee without exciting any real regret from
any party. <em>Punch</em> chronicles its withdrawal without any comment, but
his silence cannot be interpreted as expressing satisfaction with the
existing <em>régime</em>. In 1899 he falls foul of Sir John Gorst, then the
acting head of the Board of Education, for his alleged intention of
entrusting the teaching of all other children to half-educated pupil
teachers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>The progress and passage of the much-discussed Education Act of 1902
revived <em>Punch's</em> distrust of the so-called "friends" of the human
child. He shows Mr. Balfour on a bicycle steering a perilous and
devious course beset with obstacles, and develops the theme in a fable,
based on that of the Old Woman going to Market, in which Lord Hugh
Cecil, Mr. Bryce, Archbishop Temple, Mr. Lloyd George and Sir William
Harcourt are brought in to represent the various and conflicting
elements in the struggle. <em>Punch's</em> moral is that "if you don't all
hurt each others' feelings a good deal, there's no chance of getting
the Education Bill through Parliament." The truth of this comment was
abundantly shown by the vehement controversy which arose over the
famous Kenyon-Slaney amendment, limiting the right of an incumbent
to give religious instruction in a Church School&mdash;a provision which
infuriated the High Anglicans and was reluctantly acquiesced in by
moderate Churchmen. <em>Per contra</em> Dr. Percival, the Bishop of Hereford,
who voted with the Opposition, declared that the Bill had given great
strength to the Opposition to the Church in the country and tended to
destroy its spiritual influence. And Lord Rosebery, while not in favour
of the refusal of Nonconformists to pay rates, confessed that if they
submitted tamely to the enactments of the Bill they would cease to
exist politically.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>A Stepping-Stone Ministry</em></div>

<p><em>Punch</em> had no sympathy with the "passive resistance" movement,
and when Mr. Lloyd George in 1904 advocated the closing of all the
elementary schools in Wales as a protest against the Education Act,
he regarded him as more desirous to serve party ends than to save the
souls of the young. In 1906 it was the turn of the Liberals to redeem
<em>their</em> pledges, and Mr. Birrell was in charge of the measure. <em>Punch</em>
accordingly depicted him as a schoolmaster saying to the Act of 1902,
"My boy, this [the cane he is holding] can't hurt you more than it's
going to hurt me." <em>Punch</em> evidently had no love for the new Bill, but
his satire is impartially levelled at the irreconcilable sectarian
differences of the supporters and antagonists of the measure. All this
wrangling had nothing to do with the education of children. The gradual
and inevitable transformation of the measure by the end of the year
is happily hit off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> in an adaptation from "Alice in Wonderland," with
Mr. Balfour as the Cheshire Cat and Mr. Birrell as Alice carrying what
<em>had</em> been a baby, but was now a pig, as the Cheshire Cat expected.</p>

</div>

<p>The Education Office in these years was the great jumping-off ground
for aspirants to higher Ministerial office, and was occupied by a
succession of "transient and (sometimes) embarrassed phantoms." Mr.
Birrell quitted Whitehall to govern Ireland from Overstrand, and in
1908 <em>Punch</em>, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> cartoon on the tardy compromise achieved by the
Church and Nonconformity, showed "Master Runciman," with his Bill,
being carried safely through the waters of strife by the Archbishop of
Canterbury and Dr. Clifford.</p>

<p>In 1905, according to the <em>Scotsman</em> (quoted by <em>Punch</em>), the
prospective Unionist candidate for Berwick maintained before a meeting
of electors that "the only way to deal with the religious question was
to allow each denomination to provide religious teaching in school
hours <em>for the parents of such children as desired it</em>." The italics
are provided by <em>Punch</em>, who threw further light on the need for this
"vicarious religion" in an illustrated dialogue published in 1911:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Schoolmistress</span>: "And am I to give the child religious

<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span>: "I don't care wot yer do so long as yer don't bash

<div class="sidenote"><em>John Bull, Junior</em></div>

<p>Throughout this period <em>Punch</em> was perhaps more concerned with the
youngest than with the younger generation&mdash;with the progress of the
child than with that of the ingenuous youth. Yet he was not neglectful
of the changes going on in public and preparatory schools. The picture
of "John Bull, Junior,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> in 1905 represents the human boy of the
public-school type as still primarily interested in pastime:&mdash;</p>

<p>This was before the aeroplane and the motor had infected schoolboys
with a passion for mechanics, and the view expressed is borne out by
a suggestion made in 1907 by Sir J. J. Thomson, and duly noted in
<em>Punch</em>, that boys should go to school in holiday time and during term
time should "stay at home and learn something." A year earlier <em>Punch</em>
had very properly laid his finger on a blot in the school system&mdash;the
inadequate salaries of assistant masters. In "The Worm Turns" he had
enlarged on the protest which one of the number had registered in the
<em>Westminster Gazette</em>. It was all very well, as "Kappa" had done in
the columns of that paper, to abuse schoolmasters, but what could you
expect at the price when, at the best preparatory schools, £120 a year,
resident, was considered adequate pay for a first-class man, and things
were not much better in the public schools. Hence <em>Punch's</em> versified
gloss, in which the much-maligned assistant master sums up the matter
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w30"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Ah, well, it may be we are all past praying for,</p>

<p><em>Punch</em> clearly admitted that all was not well with a system in which
undue prominence was attached to the athletic prowess, and in 1909 he
pilloried an advertisement for a schoolmaster which had appeared in
the <em>Spectator</em>: "Rugby Blue required. Football is the chief subject,
but elementary Latin, English and Mathematics are also looked for." On
the other hand, <em>Punch</em> was no believer in the commercializing of our
public schools. When Lord Rosebery in 1896 had said that "an inquiry
by Chambers of Commerce into the progress of technical and commercial
education in Germany would make our hair stand on end," <em>Punch</em> showed
him as the Fat Boy in <em>Pickwick</em> saying, "I wants to make yer flesh
creep." And when, in the fateful year 1914, a "Commercial Side," on
lines already laid down in many secondary schools of a different type,
was started at Bradfield College, <em>Punch</em> sought to reduce the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> plan to
an absurdity by an imaginative account of its working.</p>

<p>The Headmaster of Rugby is reported to have said at the
recent Conference on School Diet that "while adults should rise from
the table hungry, children should reach a sense of repletion before
rising."</p>
<p><span class="smcap">House-Master</span> (with pride, to Parent): "Then with regard to
food: we feed our boys to repletion five times a day, and our chef's
puddings have no equal in any school in the kingdom."</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>School Diet</em></div>

<p>As regards the feeding of boys at school, the change from the Spartan
<em>régime</em> of the previous generation can be vividly illustrated from
the pages of <em>Punch</em>. Down to the close of the Victorian age, hampers
were, if not an absolute necessity, at any rate a welcome supplement
to the frugal diet provided at most schools. In 1899 <em>Punch</em> supported
the continuance of hampers in some ironical verses inspired by a letter
in the <em>Daily Chronicle</em> from a schoolmaster's wife. The good lady had
complained of the effect of Tuck upon the ethics of schoolboys, and
advocated ordinary school diet. <em>Punch</em> at the time regarded this as
a counsel of stoical perfection utterly wasted on the ordinary human
boy. A very different note was sounded by the Headmaster of Rugby
in 1912, who was reported to have said at the Conference on School
Diet that "while adults<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> should rise from the table hungry, children
should reach a sense of repletion before rising." Accordingly <em>Punch</em>
published a picture of a mother with an alarmingly obese small boy
interviewing a house-master who proudly remarks: "Then as to food, we
feed our boys to repletion five times a day, and our chef's puddings
have no equal in any school in the Kingdom." This was an exaggeration
so far as the public schools were concerned, but it was fair satire of
the sumptuousness of the fashionable and expensive preparatory school
of pre-war days. <em>There</em> the pendulum had swung to the opposite extreme
from the meagre diet of the 'seventies, when there was no luxury at
preparatory schools and at many of the public schools the feeding was a
scandal.</p>

<p>On the new relations that had sprung up between boys and masters&mdash;the
"elder brother" theory&mdash;I do not find any notable mention in <em>Punch</em>.
I suspect him of adhering to the old view that it was a far higher
compliment to a master to describe him as a "just beast" than
"popular." The decline of the classical side is touched on, while
the continued inefficiency of instruction in modern languages is
delightfully satirized in the late Mr. F. H. Townsend's picture of
a young lord of creation, the centre of an adoring group of small
sisters. "Now Guy," says his mother, "tell us about the school. Is
everything all right?" "Oh, yes, Mother&mdash;except one thing." "My
darling! What is it?" "Well, I wish you hadn't got us that French nurse
to teach us the right pronunciation; it makes the other fellows laugh
so." <em>Punch's</em> picture was true of a time now rapidly passing away,
and furnishes a valuable comment on the solution of a century-old
problem. The French master, generally a refugee in the old days, was
never accorded a proper status and very seldom recognized as one
of themselves by his colleagues. He was generally poor, and he was
a standing proof of the saying of the Latin satirist that there is
nothing more cruel about poverty than the fact that it makes people
ridiculous. Also nine times out of ten he was unable to keep order; so
that in the fullness of time headmasters found themselves confronted
by this dilemma. They had to choose between foreigners with a correct
accent who could not maintain discipline,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> and natives with a bad
accent who could. And in pre-war days they often decided in favour of
the latter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Commerce at the Universities</em></div>

<p><em>Punch</em> viewed the multiplication of universities with acquiescence
rather than enthusiasm. He had been, as we have seen, a severe critic
of academic obstructives at Oxford and Cambridge, but he was entirely
opposed to their reconstruction on purely utilitarian lines. In his
view there was room for universities of different types; to standardize
them would be a blunder, almost a crime. So when a school of brewing
was established at Birmingham, he gave a forecast of Oxford in the
year 2000 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, completely commercialized, with the Ashmolean
transformed into the University Co-operative Stores. In 1901 a daily
paper had said that, compared with the University of Birmingham, Oxford
must seem hopelessly out of date. <em>Punch</em> rejoined in a masque in which
the claims of the old and new universities are reviewed and contrasted,
but the last word is left to the Oxford chorus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Andrew Carnegie's gift of £2,000,000 to the Scottish universities
in the same year is eulogized in the cartoon of "The Macmillion,"
but the prose comment, in which the extensions of the scheme are
foreshadowed, is not lacking in an element of irony.</p>

<p>Mr. Rhodes's historic bequest to Oxford is discussed in an imaginary
letter from a Cambridge to an Oxford don. The Cambridge don ridicules
the notion that it would revolutionize Oxford, convert it into the
University of the Empire, or transform the hoary old home of lost
causes into a realization of the ideals of young barbarians from the
bounding prairie or of the pipe-sucking beer-nurtured students of the
Fatherland. The new-comers would find their level and, if really decent
fellows, would do well enough. "Oxford will still remain Oxford, and
that, at any rate, we may be thankful for." Nor did the Cambridge man
anticipate any serious change in inter-'Varsity relations:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As to ourselves at Cambridge, why, I fancy we shall be able to
rub along quite comfortably, thank you. If I may use a commercial
expression, we've got our own line of Australians and Canadians and
Americans, and even of Afrikanders, and I think we shall be able to
continue business at the old shop in the old style without any of the
new-fangled additions that Mr. Rhodes has conferred upon Oxford. I'll
wager that when fifty years are past we shall still be able to meet
you on the river, at cricket, at football, nay, even at chess and
billiards, on the same terms of average equality. And in after life we
shall still manage to compete.</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter, by the way, was virtually a rejoinder to a set of
verses, published a few weeks earlier, in which <em>Punch</em> indulged in
a fantastic forecast of the results of the invasion of the Rhodes
scholars&mdash;including an entire revision of the system of examinations
in accordance with the terms of Mr. Rhodes's will. The Craven would be
awarded for manliness and the Ireland for muscle:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Awakening of Oxford</em></div>

<p>In 1904 <em>Punch</em> ranged himself unfalteringly on the side of compulsory
Greek. Oxford had decided to retain it, and <em>Punch</em>, garbed as a
Hellenic sage, appeals to Cambridge not to be outdone in loyalty to the
old faith by her sister. It is hard to avoid reading into the cartoon
"Breaking the Charm" in 1909 more than <em>Punch</em> meant to express. Lord
Curzon, as the Fairy Prince, is seen, with his Memorandum on University
Reform, appealing to the Sleeping Beauty in Matthew Arnold's phrase,
"Awake, adorable dreamer!" Of course, the "adorable dreamer" was bound
to be pictorially represented by a woman, but recent concessions have
lent a special significance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> to the awakening. Strange to say, the
most powerful and eloquent impeachment of the intrusion of women into
Oxford comes from the New World; from the pen of the most brilliant of
American essayists&mdash;Mr. Paul Elmer More. "With petticoats," he writes
of Oxford, "came the world and the conventions of the world; manners
were softened, the tongue was filed, angles of originality were ironed
out; the drawing-room conquered the cloister."</p>

<p><em>Punch's</em> practical abandonment of the <em>rôle</em> of religious
controversialist was noticed in the previous volume. In the period
under review references to the churches are for the most part confined
to the part they played in connexion with the Education Bills already
mentioned. The echoes of the "No Popery" campaign had so far died
down that, on the publication in 1898 of Mr. Wilfrid Ward's review of
Cardinal Wiseman's life, <em>Punch's</em> notice was not merely sympathetic
but laudatory. "The storm that arose in England on his return from
Rome to England with the rank of Cardinal was sufficient to have blown
a punier man clean off the island. The Cardinal stood four square to
it and lived it down." This is a notable tribute from <em>Punch</em>, who
had blown and stormed with the best of the Cardinal's assailants. As
for the now forgotten but once notorious "Kensitite" demonstrations,
<em>Punch's</em> attitude is seen in his advertisement printed in the same
year:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>To Prize-Fighters and others.</em>&mdash;Wanted, <span class="smcap">MUSCULAR CHRISTIANS</span>
to act as sidesmen; used to <em>mêlées</em> and capable of using their
fists. Liberal terms. Free doctor. Pensions in case of personal
injury. Apply, stating qualifications, to High Church Clerical Agency,
Kensiton, W.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>A propos</em> of muscular Christians, in 1900 <em>Punch</em> mentions that a
country curate had recently received notice to quit because though
unexceptionable in other respects, his vicar declared that "what
this parish really needs is a good fast bowler with a break from the
off." Modern clerical methods of acquiring popularity were satirized
in 1905. A Congregational minister had taken part in a theatrical
performance, and <em>Punch</em> gave a burlesque account of a bishop appearing
at a music-hall in a travesty of <em>Hamlet</em> for the benefit of a Decayed
Curates' Fund.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Anti-Clericalism in France</em></div>

<p>Bishops and deans have done wonderful things of late years, but this
particular forecast remains fortunately unfulfilled hitherto. To 1906
belongs one of the few cartoons in this period in which the relations
of Church and State are directly referred to. For this was the year
in which the French Government cancelled the Concordat and laid an
interdict on the Religious Orders. The policy found no favour from
<em>Punch</em>. In "The Triumph of Democracy" he showed a French priest,
a dignified figure, standing outside a doorway guarded by a French
soldier, and bearing the notice: "République Française. Liberté,
Egalité, Fraternité. Entrée interdite au Clergé."</p>

body</em>!"</p>
</div>

<p>Sabbatarianism gave <em>Punch</em> little or no chance, save for a mild
protest against the action of the L.C.C. with regard to the Queen's
Hall Concerts in 1898. The change is accurately reflected in the
opening lines:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry">

<p class="i0">We're all agreed in word and deed,</p>

</div></div></div>

<p><em>Punch's</em> occupation as an anti-Sabbatarian was practically gone by
the end of the last century. Bishops had ceased to provoke his satire
by their opulence, though the balance-sheet, issued by the Bishop
of London in 1905 to prove how hard it was to make both ends meet,
excited some good-humoured raillery. Christian Science <em>Punch</em> left
severely alone, save for an occasional negligible or oblique reference.
His last and most forcible intervention in religious controversy was
provoked by the action of the Bishop of Zanzibar in protesting against
the administration of the Holy Communion to non-Anglican members. In
the cartoon "The Black Man's Burden" in January, 1914, <em>Punch</em> drew
two negroes singing as a duet "Why do de Christians rage?" and this
scathing comment undoubtedly reflected the views of the great majority
of moderate Churchmen at home as well as missionaries and colonial
administrators abroad.</p>

<p>I have spoken elsewhere of <em>Punch's</em> share in the Dreyfus controversy,
and may add that while laudably free from anti-Semitic partisanship, he
did not refrain from satirizing the ostrich-like attitude of the Jews
in transition who thought that the signs of race could be obliterated
by a change of name.</p>

<p>Reverence and admiration in full measure inspire the tribute to the
wise and sagacious Leo XIII, when he died in 1903:&mdash;</p>

<p>The <em>amende</em> to Cardinal Wiseman has been already noted, and I like
to end this section with an even more striking palinode&mdash;the most
notable that had appeared in <em>Punch</em> since his posthumous tribute to
Lincoln. <em>Punch</em> had assailed the Salvation Army and its founder with
all the weapons at his command in the early days of that movement.
Happily he did not wait till General Booth's death to acknowledge his
error. In the autumn of 1908 General Booth and Mr. John Burns had
both been subjected to severe criticism at the Trade Union Congress,
and are shown in a cartoon standing outside the door of the meeting
saying to <em>Mr. Punch</em>: "You see before you two condemned criminals."
<em>Punch</em> replies: "Well, I shouldn't worry about that," and they rejoin
in unison: "We don't." This was indirect commendation; there were no
reserves in the memorial verses on General Booth's death in August,
1912. <em>Punch</em> compares him with the warrior saints of old time and
continues:&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ADVANCE_OF_WOMEN" id="THE_ADVANCE_OF_WOMEN">THE ADVANCE OF WOMEN</a></h2>

<p>In the early 'nineties there was a penny weekly paper called <em>Woman</em>,
of a mildly "feministic" type, which took for its motto "Forward,
but not too fast." There was no reason to suspect its founders of
deliberately choosing two adjectives, each of which bore an ambiguous
meaning; taken in their literal sense they aptly epitomize the
spirit of Feminism in the early years of a phase which began with
"emancipation novels" and ended in a resort to physical force. Yet
even at the outset the more sober representatives of the movement were
being forced into the background to make way for the more strident
spokeswomen of the doctrine of equal rights. The prim spinster and
the apostles of culture were replaced by the women who were frankly
"out" to shock public opinion and flout decorum, who rode bicycles
in knickerbockers and wrote "problem" novels. The "New Woman," so
constantly referred to in these years, had many variations&mdash;athletic,
literary, worldly, but was always bent on "self-expression." The
fashionable type was caricatured in <em>Dodo</em>; the rebellious daughter
was glorified in Grant Allen's story, now only remembered in its
title&mdash;<em>The Woman who Did</em>. Ibsen was very much in the air, and his
remark that the modern daughter felt the need for "a mild kind of
<em>Wanderjahr</em>" impelled <em>Punch</em> to discourse on "Rosamund and the
<em>Wanderjahr</em>" (a good deal "after" Miss Edgeworth's story of <em>Rosamund
and the Purple Jar</em>). His views are non-committal but apparently
unsympathetic. On the other hand, he welcomed somewhat prematurely the
admission of women to the Fellowship of the Royal Geographical Society,
recognized their skill and endurance as Alpine climbers, applauded
their adoption of the calling of gardeners, hailed the appearance
of a Women's Eight on the Thames&mdash;coached, it should be added, by
a distinguished member of his staff&mdash;and duly chronicled the first
inter-'Varsity Women's hockey match<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> in 1894. The first illustration
of a woman bicycling in knickerbockers occurs in the same year. Under
the heading "The 'Arden-ing Process," Orlando addresses his companion:
"Tired, Rosalind?" and she replies with quite unfeminine brevity:
"Pneumatically." No attempt is made to represent the new garb as
unbecoming, as in the days of "Bloomerism," but rather the reverse.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p><span class="smcap">Rosalind</span>: "Pneumatically."</p>
</div>

<p>Towards the "New Woman" on her intellectual side, <em>Punch</em> was decidedly
hostile. One could not find a better expression of his views than in
the large illustration, "Donna Quixote," in April, 1894. The central
figure, wearing pince-nez and waving a latchkey, is formidable rather
than repellent. Around her on the floor lie books by Ibsen, Tolstoi and
Mona Caird, and in the decorative border (which embodies her visions)
she is seen tilting at the dragon of Decorum, and smiting down the
triple Cerberus of Mrs. Grundy, "Mamma" and Chaperon. Du Maurier's
"Passionate Female Literary Types" in the same year are unlovely to
the verge of hideousness, and the legends are frankly satirical. When
"Sarah Grand" declared that Man, morally, was "in his infancy" and that
"now Woman holds out a strong hand to the Child-man," and insisted
on helping him up by "spanking proper principles into him in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> the
nursery," <em>Punch</em> quoted back at her "Ouida's" statement that "the New
Woman was an unmitigated bore," and went on:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w34"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">There is a New Woman, and what do you think?</p>
<p class="i0">She lives upon nothing but Foolscap and Ink!</p>
<p class="i0">But, though Foolscap and Ink form the whole of her diet,</p>
<p class="i0">This nagging New Woman can never be quiet!</p>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The New Womanhood</em></div>

<p>The ironical protest registered by <em>Punch</em> against ladies who insisted
on travelling in smoking carriages and then objected to smoking, only
serves to show how far we have travelled in the last thirty years.
Another passing phase in the history of sex-antagonism is to be found
in the record of the first of many dinners at which only literary
ladies were allowed to be present. <em>Punch</em> printed a letter signed "A
Daughter of Eve who remembers Adam," who observed that "the Literary
Ladies' Dinner of the 1st of June only needed one feature to be
absolutely perfect&mdash;the presence of Gentlemen." Whether the letter was
<em>bonâ fide</em> or not, it probably expressed the view of the majority
of those present. The more violent the manifestations of the New
Womanhood, the more reactionary became <em>Punch's</em> attitude. His reaction
reached a culminating point in 1894, when he painted the following
sketch of "A Modern Madame":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>She has aspirations after the impossible, and is herself far from
probable; she regards her husband as an unnecessary evil, and her
children as disturbances without compensating advantages.</p>

<p>She writes more than she reads and seldom scribbles anything.</p>

<p>She has no feelings, and yet has a yearning after the intense.</p>

<p>She is the antithesis of her grandmother, and has made further
development in generations to come quite impossible.</p>

<p>She thinks without the thoughts of a male, and yet has lost the
comprehension of a female.</p>

<p>To sum up, she is hardly up to the standard of a man, and yet has sunk
several fathoms below the level of a woman.</p></blockquote>

<p>So again he reverts to his older views on Education <em>à propos</em> of the
"Pioneers":&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Real New Woman</em></div>

<p>By way of reducing the "misanthropic" attitude of some of the "New
Women" to absurdity, <em>Punch</em> reported a probably apocryphal dialogue
between two men: "I say, old man, is it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> true that your wife has
been asked to resign at the Omphale Club?" "Well, yes; you see, the
Committee found out that she'd been guilty of ungentlemanly conduct."
But what exasperated <em>Punch</em> most of all was the decadent preciosity of
the irregulars who espoused the cause of the New Womanhood. One need
only mention "The Woman who Wouldn't Do," illustrated <em>à la</em> Beardsley,
where "Yellow Book" morality is burlesqued in the phrase "marriage is
a degrading system, nurtured under the purple hangings of the tents
of iniquity." These moods of disgust seldom lasted long. <em>Punch</em> was
no wholesale hater of modernity, and in his verses on "The Real New
Woman" frankly admitted that there was much in her to admire. One
notes a change of ideal in the absence of any mention of her cooking
qualifications; and in the admission that "she's splendid at seeing a
joke," <em>Punch</em> acknowledges a great advance on the buxom but humourless
damsels of Leech. The first mention of a Ladies' Football Club in 1895
brings home to us the fact that what passed for prejudice in 1895
with enthusiastic advocates of sex equality has been confirmed by the
judgment of those best qualified to judge down to 1921.</p>

<p><em>Punch's</em> epigram on woman's "Asiatic hunger for degrees" represents
a passing mood rather than his general attitude to the demand. "The
lady students of the Universities," wrote <em>The Times</em> on March 13,
1896, "have received a cruel series of rebuffs in the last few days.
On Tuesday week the Congregation of the University of Oxford refused
to admit them to the B.A. degree. On Tuesday last it followed up
this blow by rejecting all the resolutions proposed as alternatives.
Yesterday the Cambridge Senate inflicted the unkindest cut of all by
practically imitating the ungallant example of Oxford." Yet, instead
of exulting over their defeat, <em>Punch</em> was decidedly sympathetic in
his cartoon of Minerva, with her owl in a cage, met at the gates of
the Oxford Schools by a corpulent bespectacled Don, who observes,
"Very sorry, Miss Minerva, but perhaps you are not aware that this
is a monastic establishment." One notes a certain inconsistency
in <em>Punch's</em> condemning women for their disregard of the fine art
of gastronomy, preferring "a tray on a rickety side-table" or the
haphazard arrangements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> of a picnic to regularity and comfort at
meals, and almost in the same breath rebuking them for flouting the
sweet domesticities of home and indulging in extravagant pleasures in
public. Another interesting sign of the times is recorded a couple of
years later in "The Modern Woman's <em>Vade Mecum</em>"&mdash;showing a reaction
against the old notion that the blue stocking must be above any regard
for appearances. Here the governing idea is that cleverness need not
be divorced from fascination; that fine heads should be covered with
pretty toques; that pince-nez are more becoming than spectacles; and
that literary women should not neglect fashion journals or sacrifice
toilet to intellect. The allusion in the same year (1898) to a Women's
Club consisting exclusively of women who would not marry because they
could not find husbands intellectual enough to suit them, was probably
an exaggeration. But there were Feminist stalwarts who virtually
expressed that view; just as there were enthusiasts of "mixed hockey,"
then beginning to come into fashion, who may not have been entirely
uninfluenced by a matrimonial motive.</p>

<p>The proposal to allow women to hold municipal office, included in the
Local Government Bill, was vetoed in 1899, but not before <em>Punch</em>
had issued a pictorial forecast of a procession, headed by the Right
Worshipful the Lady Mayor, with female mace-bearer, sword-bearer, Town
Clerk and "she-rives." The Cecil family have been of late years active
in support of the Woman Suffrage Movement, but Lord Salisbury was no
feminist. In 1899 Colonel Denny introduced a Bill making the provision
of seats for shop assistants compulsory. <em>Punch</em> describes how this
modest measure was "turned down" in the Lords on the initiative of the
Prime Minister, who scented in the concession possibilities of a revolt
of domestic servants. In 1900 the "New Woman," i.e. the heroine of the
"Woman who Did" type, is described as moribund if not defunct. The
fashion of knickerbockers went out with the century. Women chauffeurs,
however, make their appearance in 1900, and the correct designation
for them is discussed. But for a couple of years women's claims and
pretensions were largely submerged by the War. There was a strange
product much in evidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> at the Mount Nelson Hotel, Cape Town, but
Punch overlooked the vagaries which were admirably satirized in a once
famous Limerick:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">There was a young lady of Berwick,</p>
<p class="i0">Whose conduct was highly hysteric.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Housewife's Burden</em></div>

<p>The Club movement was spreading rapidly, and the founding of the
"Ladies' Army and Navy Club" in 1902 prompts a burlesque on the
qualifications insisted on for membership in the Ladies' Athenæum,
Conservative, Travellers' and Bachelors' Clubs. <em>Punch</em> again sounds
the plea for the revival of domesticity in the "Prayer of a Lady

<p>An article by Mrs. Alfred Sidgwick in the <em>Cornhill</em>, on English and
Teuton domestic ideals, served <em>Punch</em> in 1904 as the text for a ballad
comparing the thrifty German <em>Hausfrau</em> with the extravagant English
wife. The infatuated writer sums up entirely in favour of the dainty,
decorative Dolly as against the patient, industrious, but dowdy Grisel.
Yet in the same year <em>Punch</em> was much exercised with the inevitable
decline of chivalry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Matrons and Militants</em></div>

<p>An equally interesting feature of the times was what might be
alternatively called the Revolt or the Apotheosis of Middle Age.
Perhaps the first mention of what threatened to be an unfair
competition of the matron with the maid is to be found in the verses in
1896, where we read of the modern woman:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w34"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">If married and mother she yet plays her part,</p>
<p class="i0">With six charming children she still must look "smart,"</p>
<p class="i0">For, judging by facts, what Society likes</p>
<p class="i0">Is a maid who is bold, and a matron who bikes.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Golf and dancing, however, were the great opportunities of the young
middle-aged women who refused to retire to the shelf as in early
Victorian days. In 1904 <em>Punch</em> printed a story about golf, in which
a maiden aunt "scores" overwhelmingly and turns out to be a champion
player, to the confounding of her nephew and niece, a <em>dénoûment</em>
beyond imagination's widest stretch twenty years earlier.</p>

<p>With 1905 we plunge into the new phase of the Suffrage question. At
the outset <em>Punch</em> was decidedly sympathetic. Note, for example, the
cartoon in which a beery working man&mdash;a "qualified voter"&mdash;addresses
a well-dressed, refined-looking woman: "Ah, you may pay rates an'
taxes, and you may 'ave responserbilities an' all; but when it comes to
<em>votin'</em>, you must leave it to <em>us men</em>!" In a brief year <em>Punch</em> was
thoroughly estranged by the methods of the militants and their harrying
of Ministers. His "Sensible Woman" retorts on her "Shrieking Sister":
"<em>You</em> help our cause? Why, you're its worst enemy." Raids on the House
of Commons and scenes in the Lobbies and the Ladies' Gallery drove him
in the Epilogue to 1906 to take a new line. Since in the course of
the Crusade women had descended to man's brutal level, put off their
dignity and womanliness, and become "the complete elector"&mdash;"why, then,
Madam, when you get the franchise, as you will eventually, I shall say
to myself&mdash;<em>Serve 'em right</em>." The name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> "suffragette" had been coined,
and came to stay for about fifteen years, at any rate; <em>Punch</em> tried
his hand at a new variant&mdash;"the Insuffrabelles." It was still possible
to laugh at a movement which intermittently ministered to mirth; as,
for example, when a New York correspondent of a London paper wrote as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In the course of a sympathetic discussion on the good work done for
the cause by the Suffragettes in London at a meeting of a woman's
society for political study, Mrs. Cory, a prominent advocate of female
equality, gave a definition of a Utopian dream which woman must not
rest until she has realized. 'Knowing as I do our ideals,' said Mrs.
Cory, 'confident as I am that we shall attain them, I fix my gaze
upon the brightening future, hopefully awaiting the time when a woman
on trial for her life will be defended by a female lawyer, convicted
by a female jury' (the natural result, we presume), 'sentenced by a
female judge, consoled by a female chaplain, and executed by a female
executioner. Then, and not till then, will she have attained her
proper place in the world.'"</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Punch</em>, with commendable reticence, contents himself with observing,
"nothing, however, was said as to which world." In 1907 we encounter
a picture describing the embarrassment of an unfortunate man
invited to tea at a ladies' club by a lady who had forgotten that
the afternoon was consecrated to a "Down with Men" Meeting. In
"Cross-examining a Suffragist" <em>Punch</em> dexterously manoeuvres a
witness into the admissions (1) that nothing could cause Miss Pankhurst
greater suffering than to stay idly at home while other women were
demonstrating and going cheerfully to martyrdom; (2) that the greater
the suffering, the greater the proof of faith in the Cause. Whereupon
his Lordship then delivered judgment as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Argument and Ridicule</em></div>

<blockquote>

<p>That Miss Pankhurst and her family should show their faith in
the cause by suffering in the way suggested by <em>Mr. Punch</em>. That
they should stay quietly at home for a while&mdash;keep out of the
newspapers&mdash;arrange no demonstrations&mdash;go to no prison; seeing that
this would be a much truer and more effective martyrdom than anything
they had done as yet.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"And," continued his Lordship, waxing eloquent, "if time hangs heavy on
their hands&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Budding Suffragette</span>: "I say, Pussy" (with intensity), "are you

</div>

<p>From argument <em>Punch</em> turned to burlesque in his imaginary forecast
"The Fight for Childhood Suffrage in 1927." One cannot blame him
for making capital out of a misprint in which the various suffrage
societies were credited with "tactics that differ, but whose aims
lead to the same <em>gaol</em>." But argument and ridicule were powerless to
influence the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> extremists. The moderates did not always disavow the
methods of lawlessness. A highly respected and elderly peeress actually
advocated the withdrawal of all subscriptions to charitable objects
until women should be given the vote. A steady <em>crescendo</em> in violence
marks the progress of the campaign in 1908. "How long," asks <em>Punch à
propos</em> of "domiciliary" visits and raids, "are our Cabinet Ministers
to be made the sport of clamorous women? Cattle-driving in Ireland,
deplorable as a form of popular pastime, is a trifle compared with
this new sport of Cabinet Minister-hunting?" This new sport, however,
was only in its infancy. Meanwhile the merry game of martyrdom went
on. One day, so ran the recital of her prison experiences given by a
released Suffragette, "we organized a grand lark. We all agreed to roar
like hungry animals at dinner-time. We made a fearful noise." After
this, remarks the sardonic <em>Punch</em>, "we hope we shall hear no more
of women being devoid of a sense of humour." But even at this early
stage of the campaign <em>Punch</em> seems to have realized that, apart from
the merits of the case, the victory would rest with the side which
made itself the greater public nuisance until its wish was granted.
Mr. Asquith is shown in the summer of 1908 with a Suffragette playing
the Beggar-maid to his Cophetua, and saying, "'This beggar-maid shall
be my Queen'&mdash;that is, if there's a general feeling in the country
to that effect." A couple of weeks later Mr. Haldane, "thinking
Territorially" as he watches a procession of Suffragettes, enviously
observes, "If I could only get the <em>men</em> to come forward like this!" On
the whole, <em>Punch</em> jibes impartially and genially at Suffragists and
anti-Suffragists alike. There is an ominous reference in the summer of
1908 to the remark of a stone-thrower: "It will be bombs next time,"
but pictorially, at any rate, <em>Punch</em> was inclined to make light of the
persecution of Ministers and M.P.s.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Coming of the "Flapper"</em></div>

<p>In a cartoon at the end of the year, by an inversion of the classical
legend, "Persea" (the anti-Suffragist League) is shown coming to the
rescue of Mr. Asquith as "Andromedus," while the spirit of Milton is
invoked in a mock-heroic sonnet, after Wordsworth:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Flapper was destined to assume a more aggressive aspect in
later years&mdash;<em>vide</em> Dr. Shadwell's indictment in the <em>Nineteenth
Century</em>&mdash;but <em>Punch's</em> concluding reflections hold good. Her attitude
towards the Suffrage movement at this stage was perhaps not unfairly
summed up in the remark of a younger sister who declared that she did
not want women to get the vote, because she "liked hearing about the
Suffragettes."</p>

<p>In 1909 the policy of hunger-striking was adopted by the militants;
<em>Punch</em> refers to it, but cannot be blamed for failing to realize the
disastrous possibilities of what proved to be perhaps the most sinister
legacy of the Suffragist extremists to the forces of disorder. In 1910
he waxes ironical over Lady Cook's suggestion that it would be wiser
for the men to capitulate at once. Their rule, she asserted, was nearly
over; but, if and when the tables were turned, women must not retaliate
but resist all attempts to humiliate and degrade men. This magnanimity
only excited <em>Punch's</em> mirth; and the advertisement in a weekly paper:
"Lady, having quarrelled with all her friends, desires to meet another
in same position," impelled him to devise the rules for a "Mutual
Aggravation Society" for the special benefit of the more militant
Suffragettes, misogamists and man-haters. <em>Punch</em>, I may note in
passing, acknowledged the enterprise of the woman aviator, <em>à propos</em>
of an announcement in the <em>Daily Mail</em> that already "Five women can
fly," but deplored their unsightly kit, which suggested an Esquimaux in
goggles.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Cabinet Cleavage</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></div>

<p>To return to the Suffrage campaign, the troubles of the Prime Minister
are indicated in a cartoon showing Suffragist and anti-Suffragist
tilting at one another in the ring while Mr. Asquith, endeavouring to
get out of the way, remarks: "This is no place for me." A little later,
under the heading "Excelsior," a determined-looking Suffragette appears
as Sisyphus rolling up a huge stone labelled "Women Suffrage," and
saying: "It's no good talking to me about Sisyphus. He was only a man."
During the next three years and a half <em>Punch</em> repeatedly illustrated
the cleavage in the Cabinet and amongst the Suffragists, and exhibited
a progressive resentment against the violence of the extremists. In
"Sermons in Stones" (1911) John Bull tells a non-militant Suffragist
that he could listen more attentively to her arguments "were it not
for these concrete arguments, which I find rather distracting," viz.,
the stones and bricks flying through the window of his house. In
"United We Differ" (1912) Mr. (now Lord) Harcourt and Mr. Lloyd George
are shown back to back on the same platform, advocating respectively
Votes and No Votes for Women, while in "Rag-Time in the House" (1913)
the cross-currents are shown in a dance of Ministers and Opposition
leaders. To the same year belongs the highly ironical cartoon "The
Majesty of the Law." Justice, blindfolded and wearing a fool's cap
labelled "Votes for Women," leans on her sword which is swathed in
the bandage of the Hunger Strike. In 1913 also occur the picture of
the militant Suffragist, an expert incendiary, reduced to despair by
her inability to light her own fire; and the dialogue on the Fifth
of November between two "burning Sapphos": "Coming to our bonfire?"
"Ra-<em>ther</em>! Whose house are you burning?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>So we come to the year 1914. When the militant campaign was at its
height, <em>Punch</em> prophesied that women would get the vote by 1919. He
was only a year out, but his prophecy was not complimentary. It takes
the form of an account of a great procession to celebrate the triumph
of destructive methods&mdash;burning, blowing up, etc. On reaching the House
of Commons the demonstrators find that it had just been dynamited
and was in flames, and realize that they had not left a single
building standing in London that was large enough to accommodate the
legislature. In the sequel the Vote was won, not by burning churches,
mutilating pictures, or damaging pillar-boxes, but by women's work in
the War. It was not a concession to violence, but an acknowledgment of
public and patriotic service.</p>

<p>In the realm of invention and discovery the period under review was
richer in achievements than any of those dealt with in the preceding
volumes. Again and again imaginative or fantastic forecast was outdone
by reality. Road traffic was revolutionized by the coming and rapid
development of the motor. Space and distance were annihilated by man's
conquest of the air and the introduction of wireless telegraphy.
Scientific research, by the discovery of X-rays and new elements,
more than equalled the pretensions of mediæval thaumaturgists. The
cinematograph added a new entertainment and terror to life. The
submarine, it is true, dated from the time of the American Civil war,
but its improvements clearly foreshadowed the formidable part it was
destined to play in the Great War. The long and splendid annals of
Arctic and Antarctic explorations were crowned by the exploits of Peary
and Amundsen and our own heroic Scott. On this side of the New Order,
as on others, <em>Punch</em> supplies a commentary which, though necessarily
incomplete and irregular, is invariably animated and often instructive.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Motors and Motorists</em></div>

<p>To begin with <em>terra firma</em>, one finds an early illustration of the
motor in 1895, when the Hackney observes to the Shire-horse: "Look
here, friend Dobbin, I'll be shod if they won't do away with us
altogether some of these days." The road in the picture is crowded
with bicyclists, male and female, with a traction engine and a "patent
road locomotive" of the waggonette type in the foreground. In 1896 the
unsettled nomenclature of this "new monstrosity from France" is shown
by the various alternative names&mdash;autocar, automobile, etc.&mdash;gradually
settling down to motor-car. Bells were used as signals&mdash;<em>vide</em> the
poem "Tinkle, twinkle, motor-car"&mdash;and a speed of twelve miles an
hour is spoken of as typical. <em>Punch</em> was busy throughout the year
with forecasts and prophecies&mdash;a motor Derby; a "motor-crawler" for
deer stalkers, not altogether unlike the "scooter" of recent years;
a motor-coach for the Lord Mayor's procession; and a "moto-growler"
almost indistinguishable from the electric brougham. Reference is made
to the trial run of motors from London to Brighton, and the frequent
breakdowns associated with motoring in its early stages are illustrated
in the conjugation of the new verb to "mote":&mdash;</p>

</p>

<p>In 1897 <em>Punch's</em> doggerel verses on "Motor-car-acteristics" are
entirely disparaging to the new mode of locomotion, on the score of
noise, smell and risk. With the new century the question of control
became urgent, and while <em>Punch</em> burlesques the grandmotherly
restrictions adopted by some local authorities, his "Merry Motorist's
Lament" in 1901 is aimed at the selfishness of those who resented the
claims of pedestrians, horses, children, dogs, etc., to the use of the
roads. Policemen were already employed to time the speed of motorists,
but no distinguishing numbers were yet carried. To 1902 belong the
first illustrations of the motor-bicycle and of "trailers" attached
to the "push-bike." Breakdowns and the wearisomeness of motoring
"shop" form the theme of verses in 1903. The adoption of the word
"chauffeur" is resented by <em>Punch</em> on patriotic grounds; but while
suggesting various alternatives for the word "road-hog," which had now
come into use, he has no mercy for the nuisance which had called it
into being. When the speed limit was abolished in this year, <em>Punch</em>
vigorously opposed the concession, and in the text to his cartoon
suggests that the true remedy was to be found in limiting the power of
the engines. From this date onward the motor-car, being more or less
firmly established as an integral part of the locomotive system, passes
from the domain of the abnormal, and is superseded as a theme for
speculation and prophecy by the airship and the aeroplane.</p>

<p><em>Punch's</em> first picture of a flying machine in this period occurs in
the autumn of 1894. The mechanism is, however, purely fanciful, and
the design more remote from the actuality of 1908 than that which I
have reproduced in Vol. I., p. 73. The <em>Annual Register</em> for 1900
records under date July 2 the flight of Count Zeppelin's airship from
Friedrichshafen to Immenstaad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> on the Lake of Constance&mdash;a distance of
three and a half miles. In the following year <em>Punch's</em> "leaves from an
aeronaut's diary", though purely farcical, are yet of interest as the
earliest reference in his pages to flying in a "dirigible" as a <em>fait
accompli</em>. How modest <em>Punch's</em> prophecies were in regard to speed
may be judged from his picture&mdash;at about the same date&mdash;of an aerial
"bobby" arresting people for flying at thirty miles an hour! The flying
motor-cab represented in 1902 belongs to the realm of uncircumstantial
imagination, but in 1906, though ballooning is still spoken of as
a fashionable amusement and is recommended, under the heading "If
Pigs had wings," to road-hogs in search of a new thrill, a note of
realism is struck by the use of the word "aeroplane" and reference to
the £10,000 prize offered for the first airship flight from London
to Manchester. The picture of aeroplanes at the close of this year
recalls the Japanese box-kite. <em>Punch</em> was evidently a little lax in
his terminology. The balloon he commended to the "road-hog" probably
meant the airship, for he almost simultaneously speaks of the passing
of the old gas balloon, and when in 1907 <em>Punch</em> published a design for
a new penny piece "in accordance with Britannia's aerial ambitions,"
Britannia is shown in mid-air in what is apparently the car of an
airship, certainly not the old "basket" of a balloon.</p>

<p>If <em>Punch</em> failed in 1908&mdash;the <em>annus mirabilis</em> of the Conquest of
the Air&mdash;to recognize the paramount claims of the Brothers Wright,
it must be borne in mind that the notorious aversion from publicity
shown by those pioneers, and the deliberate secrecy with which they
had conducted their experiments, kept them for a while out of the
limelight. Mr. Farman's exploits in the early months of 1908 are duly
celebrated in the cartoon in which Icarus, watching a biplane, says:
"Confound that fellow! I wish <em>I'd</em> thought of that!" But though Mr.
Farman's efforts were completely eclipsed by those of Orville Wright in
America and Wilbur Wright at Le Mans in France, in September, October
and December, <em>Punch</em> only gradually awoke to the fact. The reference
to Wilbur Wright on September 16 conveys no clear acknowledgment of his
achievement. He is, however, by implication promoted to importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
three weeks later when we read amongst various "Messages from the
Dead" the statement of Icarus: "The word aeroplane is a monstrosity
to Elysian ears, and the mere mention of W(ilbur) W(right) puts me in
a wax. Anyhow, no sea can be called after a man with such a name." An
allusion in the following week to Wilbur Wright's avoidance of the
"snap-shooter" helps to explain how it came about that he never figured
in a cartoon. M. Bleriot's first cross-Channel flight in 1909 made a
prodigious stir, and <em>Punch</em> chronicled it in the figure of "Winged
Victory" landing on the cliffs at Dover.</p>

<p>Wireless telegraphy makes its <em>début</em> in the pages of <em>Punch</em> in
1894, when the verses "Hail, Columbia!" associate it with the name
of Nikola Tesla, the electrician, born on the borders of Austria and
Hungary, who migrated to the States in 1884. Five years later the
Fairy Electricity, armed with wireless, gives warning to submarine
cables and land telegraphs that she won't be able to keep them much
longer. <em>Punch</em> was here a previous prophet; but he showed a decidedly
"intelligent anticipation" in his article on "Marconigrams" in January,
1902, where he predicted accurately enough some of the drawbacks
involved in the tapping of messages by "receivers" other than those for
which they were intended. The word "Marconigram"&mdash;in itself a tribute
to the predominance of Signor Marconi's "system"&mdash;was then brand-new.
<em>Punch's</em> use of it antedates by a week the earliest reference quoted
in Murray.</p>

<p>The name of Marconi was for several years unfortunately mixed up with
a resounding politico-financial scandal, arising out of a traffic
in shares in which the inventor was never even remotely implicated.
<em>Punch</em>, therefore, had an extra reason for acknowledging his great
services to humanity in the "S.O.S." cartoon in October, 1913, when
a great disaster was averted by a wireless message from a liner in
distress.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Submarine of Fancy and Fact</em></div>

<p>Until the beginning of the new century <em>Punch's</em> treatment of the
submarine was mainly fantastic with intermittent moments of misgiving.
The former mood prevails in his burlesque sequel to Jules Verne's
<em>Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea</em>, printed in 1899, in which
Esterhazy and Du Paty de Clam (notorious personages in the Dreyfus
"affaire") are introduced along with "Captain Nemo." The submarine
was at the moment chiefly associated in the public mind with Jules
Verne's romance, and on that very account was perhaps treated less
seriously than it deserved. Jules Verne, as we now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> know, was aggrieved
that his countrymen did not recognize him as a scientific writer. But
French engineers and inventors were busy with the problem, and in
1900 M. Rousseau's "submersible" inspired <em>Punch</em> with a cartoon in
which Neptune warns Britannia of the new menace to her rule, while
Britannia replies that she is not asleep. The heading "Rousseau's
Dream" certainly implies scepticism, but little more than a year later
<em>Punch</em>, in May, 1901, had come to recognize the grim actualities of
the new branch of the Navy:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir Percy Scott's warning on the eve of the war of 1914, as I notice
elsewhere, was not taken seriously by <em>Punch</em>. To go back to 1901, it
was in that year that an acute controversy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> raged over the efficiency
of the "Belleville" tubular boilers, but <em>Punch</em> contented himself with
merely registering the conflicting views of the experts.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p class="center">A NEW STAR</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Röntgen Rays and Radium</em></div>

<p>The discovery of the Röntgen rays in 1896 and of radium in 1903 are
not absolutely neglected; but that is about all that can be said of
<em>Punch's</em> frivolous comments on these momentous new-comers. On the
other hand, the possibilities and abuses of the cinematograph were
his constant preoccupation from 1896 onwards. <em>Punch</em> attended an
exhibition given by a M. Trewey in that year, and, while making play
with the exhibitor's name, was sufficiently up-to-date to allude to
the "Pictures" and to foresee the inevitable abbreviation of their
classical title. In 1901, under the heading "What it must never
come to," <em>Punch</em> only too correctly foreshadowed the vulgarity and
indecorum of the film play in later years.</p>

<p>Nearly half a century earlier <em>Punch</em> had chronicled the flight of the
"Wild geese" to the gold diggings in California and Australia. Later
on South Africa had become the lure to all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> who suffered from the
<em>auri sacra fames</em>. In 1897 it was the turn of the New World again,
and Klondyke and the Yukon were words on every lip. The old story of
fortunes and failures was once more repeated, though not on so large
a scale, and <em>Punch</em> summed up its lessons in his pessimistic picture
of exhausted diggers in Arctic surroundings lying at the feet of a
sinister skeleton figure guarding a great gold nugget.</p>

<p>In the domain of non-commercial exploration three phases are to be
noted: Nansen's "Farthest North" in the 'nineties, Peary's Conquest of
the North Pole in 1909, and the Antarctic tragedy of 1912. Nansen's
gallant effort was happily above criticism; and his fame, won in this
arduous field, has of late been enhanced by his disinterested and
humane persistence in the relief of the victims of the Great War.
Peary's triumph, though great and incontrovertible, was clouded at the
time by the extraordinary controversy which arose out of the rival
claim of another American explorer, Dr. Cook. His story, according to
which he had reached the Pole before Peary, was accepted at Copenhagen
and did not lack a certain amount of American backing. In his earliest
comments on the contradictory reports <em>Punch</em> preserved an attitude of
judicious caution, tempered with ironic satisfaction that the rival
claimants were both Americans. But the publication of Dr. Cook's
narrative converted this suspense of judgment into incredulity and even
ridicule. The name of Dr. Cook's chief native witness, "Etukishook,"
was, to put it mildly, unfortunate. <em>Punch's</em> final comment took the
form of a cartoon in which the American Eagle was shown sitting on the
top of the "Big Nail" and complacently remarking: "My Pole, anyway!"</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Antarctic Tragedy</em></div>

<p>From Dr. Cook's narrative to the journals of Captain Scott is a step
from the ridiculous to the sublime. Here, again, there had been
rivalry, but rivalry without dispute. The goal had been reached by
Roald Amundsen, the Norwegian explorer, only a few weeks before Scott
and his four companions, Captain Oates, Dr. Wilson, Lieutenant Bowers
and Petty Officer Evans&mdash;all of them "names to resound for ages." In
March, 1912, "Captain Scott and his gallant comrades reached the South
Pole and died on their homeward way." With this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> brief sentence <em>Punch</em>
prefaces his memorial verses on what was at once the most tragic and
heroic episode in all the long annals of Polar exploration:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

<p>In this context I may note two great disasters, the one at the
beginning and the other at the end of this period, which served to
illustrate the "price of Admiralty" and the perils of speed when
combined with enormous size and structure of a type in which design
has outrun strength. The first was the loss of the <em>Victoria</em> in
the manoeuvres off Tripoli in 1893, owing to an error in judgment
on the part of a great admiral&mdash;Sir George Tryon. The second was
the loss of the <em>Titanic</em> in April, 1912. <em>Punch</em> in both instances
confined himself to the expression of sympathy and condolence, without
endeavouring to draw morals or recalling, <em>à propos</em> of the <em>Titanic</em>,
his curious prophecy, given in an earlier volume, of the likelihood of
just such a disaster resulting from the cult of speed at all costs and
in all weathers.</p>

<p>The perils of the sea naturally suggest the means of endeavouring to
avoid them. After a long interval the Channel Tunnel scheme was revived
in 1906, and in his cartoon in January, 1907, <em>Punch</em> indicates that
it was calculated "a double<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> debt to pay." Neptune is shown objecting
to have his power undermined, but Britannia retorts: "I want to see
more of my friends over there, and I never look my best when I've been
seasick." So again, in August, 1913, under the heading "The Entente
Tube," when the steward on a night Channel boat observes, "If they
bring in this 'ere tunnel, my job's gone," <em>Punch</em> replies, "That's the
only sound objection I've heard yet."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Punch's Prophecies</em></div>

<p><em>Punch's</em> forecasts and prophecies are mentioned under various
headings, but two may be specially noted here. In 1909 a foreign
officer (obviously a German) is depicted by Mr. George Morrow in the
car of an airship "after dropping a shell with the idea of destroying
London." "Tut! tut!" he observes, "I've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span> missed it." The second
picture, in October, 1910, is of "The New Arm and how to use it," and
illustrates the conversion of a number of soldiers, by the device of
opening umbrellas of a peculiar pattern, into what the approaching
air-scout takes to be a field dotted with gigantic flowers. But, as
I showed in an earlier volume, <em>Punch</em> described the principle of
<em>camouflage</em> in full detail about half a century before it was carried
into practice.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Cabs v. Taxis</em></div>

<p>London underwent many notable changes, structural and otherwise,
between 1892 and 1914, but perhaps the most remarkable were brought
about by the engineer rather than by the architect. Macadam had yielded
to asphalt, and now asphalt largely gave place to the wood pavement.
Electric lighting became general, and with the "electrification" of
the old Underground a favourite source of well-founded complaint was
finally removed. But the conspicuous and outstanding feature of London
traffic in this period was the coming of the Tubes, while above ground
it was revolutionized by the motor, and the passing to a great extent
of horse-drawn vehicles. As early as 1902 Mr. Briton Rivière uttered
a lament over the disappearance of the horse from London traffic. His
point of view was quite intelligible, but it was purely artistic.
<em>Punch</em> was a great lover of the "noble animal," but it was precisely
for that reason that he welcomed its release from the drudgery and
suffering, the maltreatment and overloading inseparable from the old
order. The speeding-up of street traffic brought with it new perils
and noises, but it freed us from many discomforts and nuisances&mdash;for
example, the "cab-runner," rampant in the middle 'nineties, who plagued
unprotected females by his extortions and insolence until the coming
of the taxi ran him off his legs. At the time of the South African
War, when <em>Punch</em> noted the commandeering of 'bus horses for service
at the front, he declared that there had been hardly any improvement
in the public vehicles of London since the days of Shillibeer&mdash;the
coach-builder who introduced omnibuses to London in 1829. It is true
that the drivers were famous for their conversational powers, which
motor-bus drivers are unable to exercise owing to their isolation, but
only mediævalists can lament the passing of the old lumbering, stuffy
'bus, dimly lit by oil lamps, and in wet weather redolent of damp
straw. As for the "growler,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> <em>Punch</em> was decidedly premature when in
1905, the centenary of the year in which public conveyances first plied
for hire in London, he assumed that its reign was over. In 1907 he paid
the "growler" the homage of a cartoon in which <em>Punch</em>, attended by the
shades of John Leech and Charles Keene, admitted that the "Cabby" had
been "very useful to him"&mdash;as a target for generally hostile criticism.
In spite of <em>Punch's</em> repeated valedictions, the "growler" continued
to emerge during strikes in later years, and I am not certain whether
it can be pronounced to be dead even yet. In 1907, again, there is a
curious reference to the now largely disused practice of whistling for
cabs. An irritated hansom-cabby observes to a gentleman who has been
whistling for a "taximeter cab" for ten minutes&mdash;in series of three
whistles&mdash;"Try <em>four</em> whistles, guv'nor, and p'r'aps you'll get an
airship." The whistling code had first of all to be revised so as to
establish the precedence of the "taxi,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> and then was simplified by the
disappearance of the "growler" and the hansom. In this context may be
quoted the epitaph based on the fact that a French traveller had taken
"Job Masters" to be a personal name, and published in 1909:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The L.C.C. Trams</em></div>

<p>On the vexed question of the extension of the tramway system to
central London <em>Punch</em> did not maintain an inflexible consistency.
In 1905 he supported the L.C.C. in their effort to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span> carry the tram
system across Westminster Bridge and along the Embankment, and when
their Bill, passed in the Commons, was thrown out by the Lords, he
showed Lord Halsbury, the leader of the Opposition on this occasion,
as an out-of-date Horatius, <em>Punch</em> informing him that "this isn't
ancient Rome. This is modern London, and you've just got to move on."
Yet in 1907 the congestion of empty trams between Blackfriars and
Westminster Bridge moved him to ridicule the L.C.C.'s "Spectacular
Vacuum Embankment Trams," and to paint a fancy portrait of a grocer's
assistant who had actually succeeded in riding in one of them. Later
on, again, on the eve of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> War, <em>Punch</em> made it clear that he had
no sympathy with the L.C.C. in their obstinate preference for trams as
opposed to motor-buses. The L.C.C. tram was "beaten on points" by its
more flexible rival. "Hard lines on me," says the tram. "Yes," retorts
the motor-bus, "it's always hard lines with you, my boy. That's what's
the matter; you can't side-step."</p>

<p>But the coming of the new order in London locomotion dates
appropriately from the year 1900. Early in that year <em>Mr. Punch</em>
describes his experiences on a trip from the Monument to Stockwell in
what he calls the "Sardine-box railway," dwelling on the scrimmages of
passengers and the rocking of the trains, and endorsing the company's
advertisement that it was the "warmest line in London." Criticism
gives place to eulogy in the summer, when the fairy "Electra" gives
the Steam Locomotive Underground Demon notice to quit, and <em>Punch</em>
adopts the phrase, "The Twopenny Tube," from his lively but short-lived
contemporary the <em>Londoner</em>. "Horace in London" indites a "Carmen
Tubulare" in honour of the new Underground, and a burlesque article is
based on the notion that the ozone generated in the Tubes would lead
to a monstrous growth of appetite. The new and highly irregular verb,
"Tu be," is conjugated in all tenses and moods, beginning: "I tube,
thou payest tuppence; he Yerkes<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a>; we get a hustle on; ye block the
gangways; they palm off 'bus tickets." Complaints of over-crowding
testified to the popularity of the new method of transit, and the
voice of the "strap-hanger" was soon loud in the land. The congestion
on the suburban railways had moved one of <em>Punch's</em> bards to poetic
remonstrance as early as 1901:&mdash;</p>

<p>While there was this feverish activity in developing surface and
subterranean communications on land, the apathy of the authorities in
failing to develop an efficient service of steamboats roused <em>Punch</em>
to repeated protests&mdash;notably in the cartoon where Father Thames
explains to a French visitor: "I ain't allowed to have any boats." In
more complacent mood, however, Father Thames ejaculates, "Well, I'm
blowed! This quite gets over me," as he surveys the opening in 1894
of the great Tower Bridge, or "the Giant Causeway," as <em>Punch</em> calls
it. In 1896 <em>Punch</em> was concerned with the intention of the L.C.C.
to do away with Chelsea Reach, and did not disguise his satisfaction
when the scheme was "turned down" by a Select Committee. On the other
hand, the unkempt and squalid condition of what he sarcastically calls
the "Surrey Riviera" suggested a cartoon in January, 1913, exhibiting
Father Thames in his filthiest guise saying plaintively, "I know a bank
where the foul slime flows."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>London's New Cathedral</em></div>

<p>The most notable of the structural changes in London in this period
was the opening of the new thoroughfare from Holborn to the Strand and
the clearing away of the old rookeries at the southern end. Kingsway
and Aldwych were the names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> coined by Sir Laurence Gomme for the
thoroughfare and crescent, and could not have been improved on; but
<em>Punch</em> exercised his ingenuity in offering a variety of suggestions
purporting to be made by famous and notorious personages of the hour:
e.g. "Via Marie," "John Lane," etc. Among single buildings the most
notable addition was the Roman Catholic Cathedral of Westminster,
consecrated in 1903. Bentley's masterpiece was the largest and most
impressive church erected in London since St. Paul's, which <em>Punch</em>, in
his irreverent "Lightning Guide" described as "London's largest temple
and the biggest Wren's nest ever known." The new internal decoration
executed in the early years of this century by the late Sir W. B.
Richmond prompted the remark that "the Christian law is upheld in the
nave, but the inside of the dome is strictly Mosaic." Mr. Hammerstein's
Opera House in Kingsway after a brief allegiance to the serious lyric
Muse went the way of other similar ventures. In the autumn of 1912
<em>Punch</em> saw in the vacant theatre a chance for English opera, but his
cartoon, "Now or Never," was not exactly optimistic, and the claims of
Variety once more triumphed.</p>

<p>When improvements on a large scale are planned and executed it has
generally been found impossible to reconcile the demands of High Art
with the aims of municipal politics. The appeal of leading artists
and architects was powerless to prevent the spoiling of the eastward
vista along the chord of the Aldwych arc. So with the scheme of the
Victoria Memorial, involving the new road from Trafalgar Square to
Buckingham Palace. In the "Finishing Touch" <em>Punch</em> represented the
County Councillor blandly correcting London's remonstrance with him
for blocking the view. Not a bit of it; he was only improving things:
"<em>ars est celare artem</em>, you know"&mdash;in reference to the action of the
"Improvements" Committee of the L.C.C. in allowing the prospect of the
Admiralty Arch to be obstructed by a building at the eastern end.</p>

<p>The French have a saying that administrative art is always arid;
<em>Punch</em> went further and roundly accused the L.C.C. of Vandalism. In
their schemes for widening Piccadilly in 1901 he scented a sinister
design of converting it into a tramway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> route, just as he had
foreshadowed the conversion of Rotten Row into a bicycle track in
1895&mdash;this, by the way, at a time when bicycling in the Park was only
allowed from 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> till 12 noon. As a faithful champion of
the equestrian interest, <em>Punch</em> renewed in 1894 the appeals he had
made in earlier years for making more rides in Hyde Park. He was much
concerned with the general dirt and disorder which reigned there&mdash;the
frowsy and immoral loungers, "socialist scamps and somnolent tramps,
scoundrels who swear and zealots who groan," and welcomed the new
rules in 1896 in the belief that they would exclude tub-thumpers,
Salvationists and atheists, "sot and satyr, crank and vandal." <em>Punch</em>,
in his zeal for maintaining the decencies and amenities of our parks,
laid himself open to the charge of an anti-democratic bias. He was,
however, sincerely proud of the glories of London, while always ready
to denounce the blots on her scutcheon. Sir W. B. Richmond's anti-smoke
crusade met with his approval in 1898. Writers who dilated on the fine
atmospheric effects of London fog jarred on his robust common sense,
but the beauties of Richmond Park in all seasons inspired him to
genuine enthusiasm. A lyrical "note" new to his columns is sounded in
the charming lines which he printed in 1910:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The End of the Westminster Aquarium</em></div>

<p>I do not find that <em>Punch</em> in his record of "disappearances" notes
the disuse of hatchments, but he duly chronicles at the close of 1895
the termination of the last of the old turnpike trusts on November
1. "Vanishing London" generally moved him to elegy. Over the Lowther
Arcade, which was closed in 1898 by the sale of the Crown lease, he
did not waste many tears, and the end of the Westminster Aquarium in
January, 1903, did not excite any passionate regret. Still, <em>Punch</em> had
seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> many strange shows and celebrities within its walls&mdash;Blondin,
Zazel and Zaeo, Slavin and Sullivan, Pongo the Ape, Sandow the strong
man, John Roberts the master of the cue; and a certain mitigated
melancholy broods over <em>Punch</em> as we watch him</p>

</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>
<p>It was another matter altogether when <em>Punch</em> heard that Clifford's Inn
was to be pulled down in April of the same year. In his indignation he
suggests that the Temple Gardens, Middle Temple Hall and Temple Church
should forthwith be sacrificed to the craze for improvements, and
continues in the same strain of exaggerated irony:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If you turn the Charterhouse into a railway station, the Tower into
warehouses and Westminster Hall into an Inebriates' Home, something
will have been done towards making London a happier and a better place.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another sign of the times which frequently exercised <em>Punch's</em> mind
and stimulated his satire was the multiplication of huge new hotels.
In 1902, when it was announced that St. James's Hall was about to
be pulled down to make room for another of these monsters, <em>Punch</em>
pictured Macaulay's New Zealander coming to visit London and finding
it entirely composed of hotels and residential flats. The luxury
<em>à l'Américaine</em> of these mammoth establishments excited <em>Punch's</em>
strictures in 1907; simultaneously he inveighs against the poky and
insanitary arrangements of the modern flat.</p>

<p>In earlier years <em>Punch</em> had been prodigal of suggestions for the
"improvement" of London; in this period he is more critical than
constructive, though I note that in 1904 he reverts to his old
suggestion of a great open-air <em>café</em>. This, he now proposed, should
occupy the ground floor of the Ritz, with a <em>terrasse</em> overlooking
Piccadilly and the Green Park. But <em>Punch</em> did not scorn the cheap
restaurants, and in one of his "Lays of a Londoner" pays homage to the
charms of Soho&mdash;a tribute culminating in this admirable stanza:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">(Sir William Bull, M.P., is anxious to form in the
metropolis a Society for Completing Modern Buildings. "Look," he says,
"at the Thames Embankment, with its pediments for sculpture, and not
one filled in, except the space which I got occupied by the Boadicea
group.")</p>
<p>It is hoped that Chelsea, with its Artists' Quarter, will take
advantage of the magnificent opportunity offered by the four chimneys
of the generating station. Why not an equestrian statue of Carlyle,
reading his own works?</p>
</div>

<p>On the subject of statues and memorials <em>Punch</em> had always held strong
views; views that by no means ministered to national self-satisfaction.
When the question of a statue to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> Cromwell came up once more in 1894,
<em>Punch</em> practically repeated his old cut, with a slight variation
of treatment, in "Room for a Big One," Cromwell addressing his
Royal rivals, "Now then, your Majesties, I hope I don't intrude."
In May, 1895, <em>Punch</em> returned to the charge in his most truculent
anti-monarchical vein:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">ON THE NEW STATUE</p>

</div></div></div>

<p><em>Punch's</em> acid remark made many years before, that we were incapable
of producing a fine statue or memorial, is virtually repeated in his
suggestion, made in 1896, for the formation of a "Metropolitan Statues
Supply Association" for the purpose of supplying public statues and
monuments on the hire system. There was certainly good excuse for the
burlesque, for, as <em>Punch</em> reminds us, "Mr. Akers-Douglas, replying to
Mr. Labouchere as to whether his attention had been called to a statue
'purporting to be of the late Mr. John Bright in the Central Lobby,'
and whether it is to remain there, said that it was erected under
arrangements made with his predecessors. He admitted that there were
very varied views as to its artistic merits."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>National Heroes and their Memorials</em></div>

<p>In 1902 the fall of the Campanile of St. Mark's at Venice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> prompts
a Trafalgar Square Lion to remark: "I only wish some of our London
monuments would come down as easily." In an earlier volume I have
mentioned <em>Punch's</em> reiterated complaints of the time taken in
completing the Nelson Memorial in Trafalgar Square. In 1903, after
fifty years had elapsed, the monument to the Duke of Wellington
in St. Paul's was still unfinished. <em>Punch</em> dealt faithfully with
this discreditable delay in a caustic perversion of Tennyson's ode,
"Bury the Great Duke," and a cartoon in which, under the heading
"Ars (Britannica) Longa," Napoleon, hearing from his victor that his
monument is approaching completion, sarcastically comments, "Déjà?"</p>

<p>On the question of burials in Westminster Abbey, it may here be added,
<em>Punch</em> was clearly not satisfied with the arrangement which left the
Dean as the chief arbiter, when he wrote in the summer of 1909:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w32"><div class="stanza">

<p class="i2">The final verdict lies with one alone&mdash;</p>
<p class="i4">A Mr. Robinson, a clergyman.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The "Mr. Robinson," thus disparagingly referred to, was that learned
divine, Dean of Westminster from 1902 to 1911, and since then Dean
of Wells. It should therefore be remembered that he was Dean of
Westminster when Irving was buried in the Abbey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">"<em>Our Robert</em>"</div>

<p>Mention has already been made of the widening of the Mall as part of
the Queen Victoria Memorial. Brock's statue and monumental group were
pronounced by <em>Punch</em> in 1911 "worthy of a great Queen and a great
City," an acknowledgment truly remarkable in one so chary of approval.
Captain Adrian Jones's Peace "Quadriga" on Constitution Hill prompted
a burlesque alternative design in 1908, with "four typical pedestrians
rampant and a motor-car urgent." In 1912 an old lady is seen asking
a policeman, "Is <em>that</em> what they call the Quadruped, officer?"
and the obliging Robert replies, "Yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> Mum; all except the lady."
Towards "Robert," by the way, <em>Punch</em> was in the main sympathetic and
appreciative throughout this period, and in one of the "Lays of a
Londoner" pays a generous tribute to the benevolent autocrat of the
highway:&mdash;</p>

<p>Later on the garden suburb is a frequent theme of genial comment and
satire based on first-hand observation, for the late Mr. F. H. Townsend
was a resident in Golder's Green, and his ingenious pencil found ample
scope in the amenities and humours of the new <em>Rus in Urbe</em>. Another
"garden" that had provoked <em>Punch</em> to less favourable comment in
earlier years&mdash;Covent Garden&mdash;was still a source of dissatisfaction as
late as 1904. When John Hollingshead died in the autumn of that year,
<em>Punch</em>, in his obituary notice of the manager of the Gaiety Theatre,
revealed the fact that "his was the dauntless hand that, under <em>Mr.
Punch's</em> banner, attacked 'Mud Salad Market' many years ago." If the
present condition of Covent Garden market is not exactly ideal, at any
rate it does not justify the censures passed on it seventeen years ago
as still blocking traffic with congested muck.</p>

<h2><a name="CROWN_AND_COURT" id="CROWN_AND_COURT">CROWN AND COURT</a></h2>

<p>In a period of change and transition, in which the decline of the
influence of the old "governing classes" was attended by the rise of a
new type of statesman, the stability of the throne and the prestige of
the Sovereign remained unshaken; the veneration in which the old Queen
was held in the last ten years of her reign was based on a respect
which rendered her almost invulnerable to criticism. <em>Punch</em>, who in
earlier years had appropriated the <em>rôle</em> and privileges of the Court
Jester, and in the middle Victorian period had frankly regretted the
Queen's long seclusion, never alludes to her in the closing years of
her reign save in a spirit of gratitude and chivalrous devotion. We
hear no more of the "Royal Recluse," for the phrase no longer applied
to one who in advanced years was strenuous in the discharge of her
duties. There is a pleasant story that when the Queen was informed that
she had reigned longer than any of her predecessors, she said: "Have I
done well?" and <em>Punch</em> supplied the answer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Have I done well?" Most gracious Queen,</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The last year of her reign was sadly clouded by the uncertainties of
the South African war, and she paid the inevitable penalty of those who
live to fourscore by surviving many of those who were nearest to her;
but age brought her consolations as well. The marriage of the Duke of
York in 1893 inspired <em>Punch</em> with a genial ode, full of classical tags
and headed "Hymen Hymenæe!" He would not "trill a fulsome lay," but
contented himself with showing "good will to goodness," typified in his
cartoon of the royal pair seated on a Lion led by <em>Punch</em> with a bridle
of roses. A year later the birth of the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> Prince of Wales, Queen
Victoria's great-grandson, is celebrated by an ingenious adaptation of

<p>The customary official congratulations of Parliament did not escape
a protest from Mr. Keir Hardie, who was "indisposed to associate
himself with any effort to do special honour to the Royal family,"
though he was "delighted to learn that the infant was a fairly healthy
one." This unfortunately-worded concession only served to exasperate
the loyalists, and <em>Punch</em> drew a picture of Mr. Hardie, in his
deer-stalker cap, severely apostrophizing the royal infant in his
cradle. <em>A propos</em> of the Prince's seven names, it may be added that
<em>Punch</em> noted the inclusion of all the four patron saints of the United
Kingdom&mdash;George, Andrew, Patrick and David&mdash;a choice which, as he put
it, ought to help him to dodge ill luck in after years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Punch on the Duke of Cambridge</em></div>

<p>No charge of courtiership, however, could be brought against <em>Punch</em>
for his treatment of the question of the retirement of the Duke of
Cambridge in 1895 from the post of Commander-in-Chief. In "All the
Difference" Lord Wolseley is shown saying to the Duke: "In September
I have to retire from my appointment," and the Duke replies, "Dear
me! <em>I</em> haven't." The same idea is developed in some satirical verses
glorifying the "Spirit of Eld," which was allowed to dominate the
conduct of high affairs of State. But when the Duke did go in November,
<em>Punch</em> was more gracious. His "parting salute," put into the mouth of
Tommy Atkins, forms a friendly gloss on what Lord Wolseley had said
in his first Army order; and when the Duke died in 1904, <em>Punch's</em>
four-line tribute is a model of laconic and judicial appreciation:&mdash;</p>

<p>Modern Royal Annals are largely made up of "marriage and death and
division," and laureates, unofficial as well as official,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> are
largely concerned with the two former. The death of Prince Henry of
Battenberg from fever incurred while on active service in Ashanti in
1896 enabled <em>Punch</em> to pay decorous and not extravagant homage to
the "servant of duty." He had a much better theme in the death of the
Prince's brilliant and ill-starred brother Alexander, in 1893, and the
verses are not unworthy of one who was too great a gentleman to be a
successful adventurer:&mdash;</p>

<p>The coronation of the Tsar Nicholas in 1896 is chronicled in the
cartoon in which Peace says to him: "I was your father's friend&mdash;let me
be yours," and his visit to Balmoral suggests another variation on the
same theme. Under the heading "Blessed are the Peacemakers," Nicholas
is seen taking an affectionate farewell of the Queen. Ten years
later <em>Punch</em> was to realize how vain were the dreams of good will
when hampered by infirmity of purpose. For the moment, however, the
pleasures and pastimes of Royalty were more in evidence. The Prince of
Wales was alleged to have taken to bicycling, and <em>Punch</em>, still wedded
to an old habit, proposed the new title of "the Prince of Wheels." The
Prince is also congratulated on winning his first Derby with Persimmon,
and encouraged to pay no attention to the Nonconformist stalwarts of
Rochdale and Heywood who had begged him to abandon racing and withdraw
from the turf. When Princess Maud of Wales was married to Prince
Charles of Denmark, <em>Punch</em> was not content with a loyal cartoon and a
suitable Shakespearean quotation. He seized the opportunity to combine
humanitarianism with allegiance to the throne by issuing a Plea for the
Birds to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> Women of England&mdash;begging them to discontinue the wearing
of egret plumes on this and every other occasion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Jubilee Tributes</em></div>

<p>In his "Jubilee Celebrator's <em>Vade Mecum</em>" <em>Punch</em> did not spare
criticism of the arrangements and the profiteering of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> speculators
in seats. Yet with all deductions and drawbacks the Jubilee "was a
gigantic success, for it has shown that a quarter of the world loves
and appreciates a blameless Queen, and rejoices to be her subjects."
The visit of the Duke and Duchess of York to Ireland in July prompts
the usual cartoon attributing to Erin the familiar suggestion of a
Royal residence in Ireland, a cure for discontent which <em>Punch</em> was
never weary of prescribing. Queen Victoria's eightieth birthday fell in
1899, and in the same number in which <em>Punch</em> welcomes the anniversary
he indulges in an unflattering pictorial comment on "Imperial Bruin"
breathing forth compliments and pacific professions while carrying on
dangerous intrigues in the Far East. Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught,
had renounced the succession to the Dukedom of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha in the
lifetime of his brother, the Duke of Edinburgh, who had succeeded to
the title in 1893. <em>Punch</em> in 1899 congratulated the Duke of Connaught
on a decision the wisdom of which was amply justified in the sequel.
Here <em>Punch</em> made no claims to prophecy: he merely showed the Duke
of Connaught waving aside the proffered honour and gave as his motto
Gilbert's often-quoted lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">

<p><em>Punch's</em> lines on the death of the Duke of Edinburgh in the following
year attain to a positively "lapidary" excellence in their discretion
and brevity:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

<p>The cartoon which linked Italy with Britannia as "Sisters in
Sorrow"&mdash;King Humbert had been assassinated two days before the death
of the Duke of Edinburgh&mdash;strikes the ceremonial and conventional note
avoided in the epitaph quoted above, and noticeable in the cartoon
prompted by the Queen's visit to Ireland earlier in the year.</p>

<p>To 1900 also belongs the first appearance in a <em>Punch</em> cartoon of the
ex-Crown Prince of Germany. In consonance with German Court tradition
he was now about to learn a trade, and as his tastes were said to lie
in the direction of typography, <em>Punch</em> offers to take him on as a
printing apprentice.</p>

<p>I have spoken elsewhere of the death of Queen Victoria in 1901; for
it was a great deal more than an event in Court history; it marked
the end of an era. <em>Punch</em>, in a commemorative number, reprinted a
great many of his cartoons, good and bad, but omitting the disparaging
or satirical pictures to which reference has been made in previous
volumes; but even with this limitation, the collection is a valuable
contribution to the pictorial history of our times. In discussing the
National Memorial <em>Punch</em> makes Art express the pious hope that London
will get something worthy of a great city and a great Queen, and, as
we have seen, in later years he acknowledged that she had done so. The
start of the Duke and Duchess of York for their visit to Australia
in March forms the theme of the pleasant fantasy reproduced on the
preceding page.</p>

<p>In August the Empress Frederick of Germany, the most highly placed,
the most gifted, and the most ill-starred of the Queen's daughters,
followed her mother to the grave. Here <em>Punch's</em> tribute, in which
Germany and England figure as chief mourners, does not represent the
hard facts, and overlooks the bitter antagonism of Bismarck to "the
Liberal English woman," as he called her, her failure to inspire
affection in the German nation, and the estrangement of her meteoric
son. But <em>Punch's</em> attitude was natural, for the Kaiser's visit to
Osborne during Queen Victoria's last illness had touched the heart
of England; and the description of the Empress Frederick as "gentle,
brave and wise" was a venial misreading of the character of one whose
fortitude, intrepidity and intellectual gifts were beyond question, but
whose individuality was too pronounced to accommodate itself to her
political surroundings.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Coronation Humours</em></div>

<p>The preparations for the crowning of King Edward furnished <em>Punch</em>
with material for a display of abundant good will to the Sovereign,
tempered by an explosion of irresponsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> frivolity. In the "Overflow
Fête," designed by <em>Punch</em> as "Bouverie King of Arms," he seized
the opportunity of making game of all his favourite butts. A court
of "overflow claims" considers the applications of Lord Halsbury,
Sir J. Blundell Maple, Mr. Gibson Bowles, "Brer Fuchs" (Emil Fuchs,
an Austrian artist much in Court favour but heavily derided by art
critics), Mr. G. B. Shaw, Mr. Alfred Austin the Poet Laureate, and
many others. Most of their alleged claims are declined, but a few
exceptions are made, as, for example, that in favour of Mr. G. R.
Sims being allowed to supply the fountains in Trafalgar Square with
"Tatcho." A procession of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> emblematic cars is mainly satirical, and
includes a "sleeping car" typical of British industry. The programme of
the Gala Performance at the National Opera House introduces Dan Leno,
and includes a masque of "Poets in Hades" on the lines of the Frogs
of Aristophanes. <em>Punch</em> also added what purported to be an Official
Coronation Ode by Mr. Alfred Austin&mdash;a masterpiece of deliberate
ineptitude&mdash;and a "Chantey of the Nations" in which Mr. Rudyard
Kipling's imperialism is burlesqued in none too friendly a spirit.
<em>Punch</em> provided a jocular epilogue to the masque: he also dedicated a
set of serious verses to the King wishing him</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">health and years' increase,</p>
<p class="i0">Wisdom to keep his people's love,</p>
<p class="i0">And, other earthly gifts above,</p>
<p class="i0">The long-desired, the gift of Peace.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The King is also hailed in a hunting picture as the "King of
Sportsmen"; and the grace and kindliness of Queen Alexandra, now as
ever, appealed to <em>Punch's</em> chivalry. The dominant "note" sounded in
<em>Punch's</em> pages is one of jocularity and good humour. He reproduces
the statement that "no fewer than 1,047 poets have sent in Coronation
Odes for the prizes offered by <em>Good Words</em>"&mdash;no longer, it need
hardly be added, the <em>Good Words</em> of Norman Macleod. American visitors
are maliciously pictured as attempting to buy coronets; and <em>Punch</em>
makes great play with the official announcement of the amount of space
allotted to peeresses in the Abbey. Duchesses were to have eighteen
inches and ladies of inferior rank sixteen; what was wanted, in
<em>Punch's</em> phrase, was "A Contractor for the Aristocracy."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Death of King Edward</em></div>

<p>The sudden and dangerous illness of the King and the postponement of
the Coronation turned all this gaiety to gloom and suspense, happily
relieved by a recovery which gave the celebrations, when they were
held, the quality of a thanksgiving as well as of a great pageant.</p>

<p>In 1903 the King and Queen visited Ireland, and <em>Punch</em> prefaced his
Donnybrook Fair rhymes&mdash;a long way after Thackeray&mdash;on their entry into
Dublin with the audacious but impenitent declaration that he intended
to adhere to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> method of spelling which bore no sort of resemblance to
Irish pronunciation.</p>

<p>Of all the Royal visitors in the years before the war, none was more
popular or "had a better Press" than King Alfonso. In 1905 <em>Punch</em>
happily contrasted past and present in his cartoon of the Kings of
England and Spain in friendly converse, while in the background the
formidable shade of Queen Elizabeth remarks with more of amazement than
approval: "Odds my life! A King of Spain in England! And right cousinly
entreated withal!" King Alfonso's marriage in the following year to
Princess Ena of Battenberg is genially commemorated in Sambourne's
happy adaptation of Velazquez; and when the infant Prince of the
Asturias made his first visit to England, the same artist gave us the
wholly delightful picture of Prince Olaf of Denmark pushing the Spanish
princelet in his "pram": "Come along, old man," he says; "I'll show
you round. I've been here before." Spain was not a royal bed of roses,
but it was at least spared the upheaval which convulsed the adjoining
kingdom of Portugal. On the assassination of King Carlos and the Crown
Prince in 1908, Britannia in <em>Punch's</em> cartoon bade King Manoel take
courage: when he was deposed by the Revolution of 1910, he appears as
a dignified figure mournfully bewailing the downfall of his House.
Simultaneously <em>Punch</em> chronicles the saying attributed to the late
Mlle. Gaby Deslys: "I am not ashamed of having the friendship of young
King Manoel," and ironically describes it as "the humility of true
greatness."</p>

<p>King Edward was born in the same year in which <em>Punch</em> first appeared,
and when he died in 1910 the commemorative number goes back to the
cartoon of "The First Tooth," published at a time when <em>Punch's</em>
comments on the Royal Nursery were more frank than decorous. But
whether as a small boy or an Oxford undergraduate, in America or India,
in illness or in health, as Prince or King, he had always found a
benevolent friend and lenient critic in <em>Punch</em>, who now saluted him in
death, in the name of Europe, as a Maker of Peace.</p>

<p>To the mass of obituary literature, mostly uncritical, which was
inspired by the passing of a great and popular personality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> <em>Punch</em>
contributed an interesting fact. There was nothing surprising in the
statement that King Edward never joined in debate in the House of
Lords; but it was curious to learn that he never voted&mdash;except for the
Deceased Wife's Sister Bill. The King's affection for his little dog
Cæsar was one of those personal traits which had moved the popular
sentiment, and <em>Punch</em> was fortunate in having on his staff a writer
who was a poet as well as a lover of dogs:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w30"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Reft of your master, little dog forlorn,</p>
<p class="i0">To one dear mistress you shall now be sworn,</p>

<p class="i0">At rest with one who loved your master well.</p>
</div><div class="stanza">

<p class="i0">Cæsar, the dead King's humble little friend.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Evidence of the unabated popularity of King Alfonso continue to appear
in 1910, when that sovereign's visit to the Duke of Westminster
prompted some frivolous rhymes on "the Merry Monarch":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w30"><div class="stanza">

<div class="sidenote"><em>Kaiser, King, and Laureate</em></div>

<p>The mention of the Kaiser is ominous. <em>Punch</em> had, for reasons
mentioned above, given him a brief respite, but one of his periodical
outbursts at Königsberg in August, 1910, provoked a cartoon
representing the Imperial Eagle re-entering his cage "Constitution" to
the relief of his keeper, whom he reassures with the remark: "It's all
right: I'm going back of my own accord. But (<em>aside</em>) I got pretty near
the sky that time. Haven't had such a day out for two years." This was
not exactly respectful treatment, but it was not so frank as <em>Punch's</em>
heading "Thank Goodness!" prefixed ten years earlier to the statement
made, by an American paper, that in a Boston Lunatic Asylum there
were eleven patients, each of whom believed himself to be the German
Emperor, but that they had no means of communicating with the outer
world.</p>

<p>King George's coronation in 1911 gave <em>Punch</em> another occasion for
mingling jest with earnest, loyalty to the Sovereign with chaff of
notorieties. The King's serious concern with his country's welfare had
already been illustrated in the cartoon in which he is seen, like his
namesake saint, attacking a dragon&mdash;that of "Apathy." At the time of
the coronation <em>Punch</em> lays stress on the heritage of sea-power that
had fallen to him, a sailor prince. In July the Prince of Wales was
welcomed in his Principality&mdash;this time, in <em>Punch's</em> picture, by a
dragon the reverse of apathetic.</p>

<p>In June, 1913, the office of Laureate fell vacant by the death of Mr.
Alfred Austin. After Southey, Wordsworth and Tennyson, the anti-climax
had been so painful that <em>Punch</em> may well be excused for the cartoon
in which Pegasus appeals to Ringmaster Asquith to disestablish him:
the Steed of the Muses was tired of being harnessed to the Royal
Circus. There are some who think that, in the best interests of the
distinguished author who was appointed, it would have been well if
<em>Punch's</em> advice had been followed.</p>

<h2><a name="VANITY_FAIR" id="VANITY_FAIR">VANITY FAIR</a></h2>

<p>In the fifty years that had passed since <em>Punch's</em> birth in 1841,
"Society," as it was then understood, had undergone a revolution which
not only changed its structure but altered the meaning of the word. It
had, in Mr. A. B. Walkley's phrase, become one of those "discoloured"
words like "respectable" and "genteel," in which the new "connotation"
strove with and gradually supplanted the old. "Society," in the old
limited sense, stood for a limited, exclusive and predominantly
aristocratic set, arrogant at times, but not wanting in a certain
self-respect. But by the 'nineties it had become amorphous, unwieldy,
cosmopolitan and plutocratic. Du Maurier, the finest and best equipped
of the commentators and critics of the old <em>régime</em>, who recognized
its distinction and its drawbacks, and satirized with impartial
ridicule decadent aristocrats and vulgar intruders, was perhaps <em>felix

</div></div></div>

<p>For "Wolf" read "Worldling" for "Jungle" read "Social World" and
<em>Punch's</em> parallel "Laws" work out well enough. But in the years that
followed it was not so much mammon-worship as the craze for excitement
at all costs that dominated the fashionable world. The vulgarity and
love of the limelight which Du Maurier had satirized were multiplied
tenfold. Society became a romp and a ramp. England began to go
dancing-mad in the 'nineties, but the harmless rowdiness of Kitchen
Lancers, of the "Barn-dance" and the "Washington Post" developed in
the new century into a mania for which historians found a parallel in
the "Tarantism" of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. We passed
through various and mostly distressing phases of the malady from the
days of Loie Fuller's serpentine contortions to the introduction of the
"Salome" dance by Miss Maud Allan. Skirt-dancing, with a superabundance
of skirts, gradually gave place to a style marked by the desire to
dispense not only with skirts but with any sort of clothing. The
wonderful performances of the Russian Ballet revealed a new world of
art and "washed out" a good deal of highly advertised and indecorous
incompetence, but in many ways proved a doubtful boon. The cult of the
male dancer revived, and the triumphs of Pavlova and Karsavina lured
the aristocratic amateur into futile and unseemly competition. This
was only one of the many signs of the love of publicity which marked
Society when it had ceased to be select.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> In the 'forties, when the
<em>crême de la crême</em> disported themselves at Cremorne, the Gardens
were reserved for their exclusive use. Now, "smartness" was the note
of Society, and "smartness" does not like to hide its light under a
bushel. In the middle 'nineties <em>Punch</em> registered his protest against
ladies who begged publicly in the streets&mdash;the "merry half-sisters of
charity," as he called them. By 1903 he indicated the spread of the
new fashion in the ironical remark that "the eccentric habit of dining
at home is, I regret to say, steadily spreading." The further course
of this anti-domestic movement is correctly shown in the cartoon of
Christmas <em>à la mode</em> in 1908, when the butler of a modern English
house inhospitably repels Father Christmas with: "Not at 'ome. Her
Ladyship is at Monty Carlo; the young gentlemen are in the Halps; and
Sir John has taken the other members of the family to the Restorong!"
<em>Punch</em> was not content with attacking the organized publicity of
social life, with which may be connected his satire of the orgy of
Pageants; he was equally vigorous in chastising its organized frivolity
and horse-play; the extravagance of the week-end pleasure-hunt; the
ostentatious folly of freak entertainments; and other excesses and
eccentricities summed up in the two detestable phrases <em>fin de siècle</em>
and <em>de luxe</em>.</p>

<p><em>Punch</em> found no traces of a Golden Age in the 'nineties, though he
admitted they were Yellow enough. For these were the years of the
<em>Yellow Book</em>&mdash;alternately regarded as typical of <em>fin de siècle</em>
decadence (in <em>Punch's</em> view) or as a symbol of literary renascence&mdash;of
the now forgotten "emancipation novel," <em>The Yellow Aster</em>; to say
nothing of the Yellow Peril and the Yellow Press. The <em>Daily Mail</em>,
by the way, was not founded till 1896. As a social satirist <em>Punch</em>,
throughout all this period, is much more concerned with the material
or physical than the mental or spiritual vagaries of the rich and
well-to-do. But a notable exception must be made in favour of that
famous&mdash;or shall I say notorious?&mdash;coterie known as "the Souls," who
are frequently referred to in 1893 and 1894. Readers anxious for
"inside" information may be recommended to consult the <em>Autobiography</em>
of Mrs. Asquith, who was one of the number.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The "Souls"</em></div>

<p>They were most of them highly born and highly gifted. Some afterwards
attained eminence in politics and literature; and it must be admitted
that they were clever enough to get themselves a great deal talked
about without deliberately courting publicity at the time. Their
audacities and unconventionalities enjoyed a considerable reputation,
but did not often get into the papers. <em>Punch</em> was obviously
"intrigued" about them, but ingeniously disguised his curiosity by
passing it on to an imaginary American visitor, "high-toned" (the word
"high-brow" was a later importation) and inquiring, who came over to
study our "Institootions"&mdash;Mr. Gladstone also used to pronounce it
that way&mdash;and wrote down his impressions for a work on <em>Social Dry Rot
in Europe</em>. So, hearing vague talk of a secret moral institution, the
Society of Souls, he set to work to collect authentic information about
them, but was everywhere baffled. The nearer he got to the shrine,
the more negative and mysterious was the information vouchsafed. But
the Philistine view is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> burlesqued in his conversation with a
fashionable lady who described the Souls as "a horrid stuck-up set of
people who did all sorts of horrid things, all read the same books
at the same time, sacrificed wild asses at the altar of Ibsen, the
Hyperborean Apollo, and were bound by a rule that no Soul might ever
marry another Soul." A year or so later <em>Punch</em> noted the report that
the Souls had ceased to exist, and would be replaced by a new club&mdash;the
"No Bodies"&mdash;of which the membership would be unlimited. Still the
Souls had had their day and, as representing an effort to establish an
exclusive social coterie to which intellect or wit formed the chief
passport, demand at least a passing word. The satire of fashionable
culture dies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> down and is never very seriously revived even in the
days when the late Emil Reich lectured on Plato at Claridge's. "Smart"
Society was more active with its heels than with its head or its heart.</p>

<p><em>Punch</em> distrusted the sincerity of fashionable ladies who professed
a desire to "elevate the masses" by organizing entertainments which
were a hotch-potch of Ibsen, skirt-dancing, exotic sentiment and frank
vulgarity. He waxes sarcastic, again, over charitable bazaars, run by
women who didn't enjoy them, for causes of which they knew nothing and
cared less. Frivolity was the thing that mattered. In the "Letters
to a Débutante" which appeared in 1894 <em>Punch</em> assumes the <em>rôle</em>
of the cynical mentor, e.g. "It is hardly possible to exaggerate the
unimportance of nearly everything that happens": "Laugh when you're
thinking what to say. It saves time." In weighing the rival merits of a
group of suitors, the preference is given to the rich German-Jew. The
decay of ballroom manners was an old subject of complaint with <em>Punch</em>,
but it was never so persistently harped upon as during the years which
began with the Barn-dance and ended with the Bunny-hug. In 1894, <em>à
propos</em> of the exuberant agility of a middle-aged Mænad, an old lady in
one of Du Maurier's pictures observes that the "Pas de Quatre" should
be "Pas du Tout" for Aunt Jane. The "Romping Lancers" are also noted,
and in "Association v. Rugby" a breathless young lady beseeches her
partner&mdash;a famous Rugby half-back&mdash;to dance "Soccer" for a little. In
1896, under the heading "The Death of the Dance," <em>Punch</em> takes for
his text the remark of a speaker at a recent meeting of the British
Association of Teachers of Dancing: "I had rather be old and teach
deportment than be young and teach people to romp the Barn-dance"; and
he bewails the conversion of the once "light fantastic" into heavy
prancing, spasmodic antics, and the general decay of elegance and
grace. The arrival in 1897 of "The Washington Post" is greeted with
ironical approval: "You take hold of a girl by both hands, try a double
shuffle, and then slide off to another part of the room and repeat
the performance." In 1898 the lines on "The Lost Art" are based upon
the statement made by a provincial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> mayor that the risk of injury was
rather greater in the ballroom than in the football field:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Ball-room Manners</em></div>

<p>In 1906 the introduction of the "Boston" waltz prompts one of <em>Punch's</em>
artists to depict the sad experience of a young lady whose partners
had all learned the new dance from American instructors, and who all
danced it in a different way. The band, by the way, is playing "The
Blue Danube," for Johann Strauss was still a name to conjure with.
References to rowdy dancing are frequent in 1907, when <em>Punch</em> printed
designs of various costumes to resist the tremendous wear-and-tear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
of the ballroom, and in 1908, when he suggests, to meet a "long felt
want," that a special space should be railed off for "plungers."
<em>Punch's</em> picture of the "Borston" as danced in 1909 belies the
ironical title "The Poetry of Motion." Long tight skirts were still
worn and are a feature of the series of suggestions, made in the same
year, by Mr. Baumer for brightening our ballrooms&mdash;the Judy-walk, the
Apache Polka, the Salome Lancers and the Vampire Valse. That same
acute observer of gilded (and painted) youth includes in his burlesque
Coronation Procession in 1911 a member of the aristocracy in the
guise of a caracoling Bacchante; and in the same year the male dancer
craze is satirized in a series of pictures showing the spread of the
infection to policemen, railway porters, scavengers, ticket collectors,
etc. The revival of old English dances dates from this period, but if
<em>Punch</em> is to be trusted, made little impression on Mayfair. Even the
most distinguished and eminent politicians did not scorn the dance. Mr.
Balfour gave a ball at the height of the season in 1912, and <em>Punch</em>
(who was not there) gave the following wholly apocryphal description of
the revels:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Tango-mania</em></div>

<p>The mention of Anna&mdash;the famous Pavlova&mdash;was at any rate topical,
for the cult of the Russian Ballet was now at its height, and in his
Almanack for 1913 <em>Punch</em> exhibited the political and other public
celebrities of the hour engaged in appropriate evolutions <em>à la Russe</em>.
The "Bunny-hug" was very properly gibbeted in a scathing cartoon, and
in his hints to social climbers <em>Punch</em> suggests various styles of
vulgar and inane dancing as a passport to notoriety. With laudable
fairness he admits, in parallel illustrations, that the Tango of fact
was a much less lurid thing than the Tango as painted by the fancy of
Puritans; but the revival of afternoon dances and the fashion of "Tango
teas" met with no approval, and in the cartoon "Exit Tango," early in
1914, <em>Punch</em>, rather prematurely perhaps, congratulated the "Spirit of
Dancing" on the passing of "the tyranny of the dullest of nightmares."</p>

<p>In one of the last of the references to the dancing craze in this
period&mdash;February, 1914, to be precise&mdash;<em>Punch</em> notes, as one of the
reasons why the Tango was already <em>démodé</em>, the fact that matrons had
taken to it with the utmost fury, after a preliminary stage of acute
disapproval. In the words of one of the younger generation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Matron v. Maid</em></div>

<p>This, however, was no new thing. It was only the latest manifestation
of a "movement" which runs right through the social history of the
whole of this period, and which may be alternatively described as the
Emancipation or the Apotheosis of Middle Age. The earliest references
to the change link it up with the coming of the New Woman. For example,
in 1894, in a "Song of the Twentieth Century," <em>Punch</em> describes the
man of the family as relegated to the shelf by his more energetic
female relatives:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Aunt Jane is a popular preacher,</p>
<p class="i2">Aunt Susan a dealer in stocks,</p>
<p class="i0">While Father, the gentlest old creature,</p>
<p class="i2">Attends to the family socks.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>But as time goes on it is in the pursuit of pleasure rather than in
the sphere of serious effort that the competition of the middle-aged
woman is noted as a new and formidable sign of the times. Thus in 1895
we have Du Maurier's picture of the Sunday caller finding that the
mother of the family is playing lawn tennis while the young ladies
have gone to church. By 1900 the youthfulness of the older generation
is made a source of complaint by the juniors. In "Filia Pulchra, Mater
Pulchrior," <em>Punch</em> genially arraigns the mothers who "cut out" their
daughters. A paper for ladies had declared that the woman of forty was
most dangerous to the susceptible male, and <em>Punch</em> enlarges on the
theme in "The Rivals," in which an eligible suitor exclaims, "Take, oh
take Mamma away!" In 1903 he recurs ironically to the subject in the
lines "De Senectute":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">However pedagogues may frown</p>
<p class="i2">And view such dicta with disfavour,</p>

<p class="i0">But if she sets a booby-trap</p>
<p class="i2">And wears a fringe, she is a treasure.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The old ideal of growing old gracefully had been superseded by a
refusal to grow old at all; and the "unfair competition" of matron
with maid is pointedly illustrated in <em>Punch's</em> "Country House Hints"
in 1908, where, after giving information about tips, dresses, etc.,
the writer observes that girls are at a discount as guests: "they
are not rich enough for Bridge, and they put a restriction on funny
stories." They may have done so fourteen years ago; but only a year
later, in a burlesque article based on the fulsome Society paragraphs
of the contemporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> Press, <em>Punch</em> made it clear that the process of
emancipation was proceeding apace:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Wise mothers&mdash;and modern mothers are seldom wanting in astuteness&mdash;do
not keep their young "flapper" daughters buried in the schoolroom
until the day of presentation. They prepare them for their complete
emancipation by a series of preliminary canters. Thus they take them
to dine at the Fitz or the Tarlton while the hair that is hanging down
their backs is still their own....</p>

<p>The upbringing of Lady Sarah Boodle has been wholly unconventional,
and as her parents spend most of their time in balloons, she is
looking forward to her first season with all the <em>fougue de dix-huit
ans</em>. Until she was sixteen Lady Sarah was allowed to read nothing but
the <em>Sporting Times</em> and the <em>Statist</em>. This led, not unnaturally,
to a violent reaction, and Lady Sarah is now a devoted student
of Maeterlinck, Mr. W. B. Yeats and Fiona Macleod. Happily this
development has not impaired her healthy enjoyment of Bridge. Last
year she won £300 at this winsome pastime.... One may fitly conclude
this group of winsome English girls with the mention of two beautiful
cousins, Lady Phoebe Bunting and Miss Miriam Belshazzar. By an
extraordinary coincidence they are both third cousins once removed of
Daphne, Lady Saxthorpe, whose coster impersonations were so marked a
feature of her late husband's tenure of office as Governor of Hong
Kong. Lady Phoebe, strange to say, never learned her alphabet until
she was nearly fifteen, while her cousin had mastered the intricacies
of compound interest almost before she could walk. Lady Phoebe
is a winsome blonde, while Miss Belshazzar is a <em>svelte</em> brunette
whose superb Semitic profile recalls the delicious proboscis of her
illustrious grandfather, Sir Joshua Schnabelheimer.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Ostentatious Luxury</em></div>

<p>Extravagant expense and ostentation&mdash;another old abomination of
<em>Punch's</em>&mdash;were not only rife, but they were constantly written up
and discussed with a foolish voice of praise in what purported to be
democratic papers. A ducal wedding in the mid-'nineties, which was
carefully "rehearsed" before it was actually solemnized, caused a
veritable explosion in <em>Punch</em> about the columns of matrimonial gush
and statistics&mdash;the "haystacks of chrysanthemums"&mdash;which deluged the
papers. In the picture of coroneted sandwichmen engaged by adroit
speculators to puff their schemes, <em>Punch</em> in 1897 was only repeating
an old indictment of parasitic peers. He had no quarrel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> with people
who took to trade openly and seriously, disregarding the old fine-drawn
social distinctions and contempt for commerce&mdash;witness his song of
"The English Gentleman of the Present Day" in 1899. But he had no
welcome for the newfangled newspaper articles on gastronomy, with
<em>menus</em> and prices, puffing well-known hotels and restaurants. The
statement of a writer in <em>The Times</em> in 1900 that "the necessaries of
life may be purchased for £2,000 a year" provided <em>Punch</em> with food for
ironical comment. A year later it was seriously maintained in a popular
monthly that, from the point of view of a smart Society woman, it was
impossible to <em>dress</em> on £1,000 a year. The standard of high living had
gone up by leaps and bounds from the days when to <em>Punch's</em> youthful
fancy £1,000 a year represented wealth almost beyond the dreams of
avarice.</p>

<p>Another old grievance&mdash;needless extravagance in the Army&mdash;raised its
head in 1900, when a correspondent in <em>The Times</em> complained that the
latest regulations issued by the War Office were like a tailor's list,
and contained details of seventy-seven kinds of gold lace! No wonder
was it, as <em>Punch</em> noted, that the fathers of subalterns in crack
regiments had to guarantee them a minimum allowance of £600 a year.
This was just before the South African war, which immediately led to
a general rise of prices&mdash;the universal excuse "owing to the war"
foreshadowing what took place fifteen years later. Parallels abound,
though on a smaller scale. Marriage is ironically declared to be
impossible for self-respecting and self-protective girls owing to the
dearth of servants. "Like the Dodo, the domestic servant is extinct,"
and <em>Punch</em>, in his list of suggested exhibits for museums, includes
the following:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Domestic Servant</em> (Mummy).&mdash;An extremely rare and finely preserved
specimen of a vanished class, whose extinction dates from 1901
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> It is therefore of the highest interest to the
Anthropologist and the Comparative Anatomist. Its duties are now
performed, perhaps more effectively, by the automatic "general" and
the electric dumb-waiter. When alive, it commanded the salary of a
prima donna, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>Aversion from work was already abroad. A fond parent is shown in this
year commenting on the recalcitrant attitude of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span> her daughter: "No, she
won't work. She never would work. She never will work. There's only one
thing&mdash;she'll 'ave to go out to service."</p>

<p>Still "smart" Society went on its way unheeding. The increasing
publicity of social life is satirized under "Public Passion" in the
recital of a young wife who writes: "We are <em>never</em> at home. I believe
it is fashionable to go to hospitals now and be ill amongst all sorts
and conditions of people." The honeymoon was passing because brides
could not face the awful loneliness of a <em>tête-à-tête</em> existence, and
welcomed a speedy return to a semi-detached go-as-you-please existence
amongst their friends. A week-end honeymoon at Brighton is indicated
as the maximum period which could be endured by a modern couple.
In fashionable speech inanity began to be replaced by profanity.
Unbridled language on the part of aristocrats and smart people led
in 1903 to the famous conversational opening of a burlesque Society
novel: "'Hell!' said the Duchess, who had hitherto taken no part in
the conversation"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a>&mdash;which <em>Punch</em> takes as his text for a discourse
upon further developments and reactions. The device of engineering and
paying for personal notices in the papers and simultaneously denouncing
the scandalous enterprise of pressmen, and the introduction of "freak"
parties from America are noticed and reproved in 1903, when amongst
other recreations of the Smart Set we read of "Shinty, a wild and
tumultuous version of hockey, in which there are absolutely no rules."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The New Mobility</em></div>

<p>At the beginning of this period bicycling was fashionable. The lines
"To Julia, Knight-errant" in 1895 refer in whimsical vein to the brief
vogue of bicycling parties by night in the City, organized by "smart"
people. Battersea Park was also frequented by fashionable riders; but
<em>Punch</em>, with a sure instinct, saw that the craze would not last,
and in the same year foreshadowed donkey-riding as the next modish
recreation. The advent of "mokestrians" was a mere piece of burlesque,
suggested perhaps by the popularity of the sentimental coster song
introduced by Mr. Albert Chevalier, but the speedy disestablishment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> of
the bicycle as a fashionable means of locomotion was correctly foretold
in one of the latest pictures from the pen of Du Maurier. Here one of
a group of fair bicyclists in the Park expresses her ardent desire for
the passing of a tyranny which she hated and only obeyed because it
was the fashion. Motoring was another matter, because it was expensive
and luxurious, and <em>Punch</em>, philosophizing in 1904 on the probable
results of a mode of motion which combined speed of transit with the
immobility of the passenger, predicted the advent of an obese and
voracious "motorocracy" with Gargantuan appetites and mediæval tastes.
In a "Ballade of Modern Conversation" which appeared in 1905, the three
outstanding topics are Bridge, motors and ailments, and about this time
<em>Punch</em> printed a picture of a gentleman who, when asked what was his
favourite recreation, replied, "Indigestion."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Future Earl</span>: "Well, what else is there to do, you rotter?"</p>
</div>

<p>The influence and example of American millionaires is a frequent
theme of satire. In 1904 <em>Punch</em> had attacked their acquisitiveness
in a burlesque account of the contemplated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> "bodily removal of
certain European landscapes." In 1905 he dealt faithfully with a
famous "freak" dinner at the Savoy Hotel, costing £600 a head, when
the guests were entertained in a huge gondola and the courtyard was
flooded to represent a Venetian lagoon. The American "enfant terrible"
in 1907, frankly discussing her relations with her parents, supplies
an interesting comment on the complexities of divorce, as described a
few years earlier by the late Mr. Henry James in <em>What Maisie Knew</em>.
The unemployment and inefficiency of the Upper Classes were admirably
satirized in a set of Neo-Chaucerian verses, suggested by a society
chronicler who had anticipated a March of the Upper Class unemployed
to the East End. In 1906 the Pageant craze assumed formidable
dimensions, and the ubiquitous activities of Mr. Louis Napoleon Parker
as Pageant-master are duly if disrespectfully acknowledged. <em>Punch</em>
had never been enthusiastic about "dressing up"; it was, in his view,
foreign to the temper of the British and essentially one of the
things which they managed better abroad. Moreover, he regarded this
preoccupation with the past as an evasion of our responsibilities to
the future. This view is pointedly expressed in the cartoon "Living
on Reputation" in 1908, where Britannia (among the Pageants) remarks:
"Quite right of them to show pride in my past; but what worries me is
that nobody seems to take any interest in my future." "Smart" people
were furiously interested in the things of the present, and for the
most part in the things that did not matter. From 1906 right up to the
war no feature of the feverish pleasure-hunt indulged in by the idle
rich escaped the vigilant eye of "Blanche," whose "Letters," when all
allowance is made for a spice of exaggeration and for the wit which
the author perhaps too generously ascribes to her puppets, remain a
substantially faithful picture of the audacious frivolity, the inanity,
the rowdiness and the extravagance of England <em>de luxe</em>, unashamed of
its folly, yet, at its worst, never inhuman or even arrogant. I don't
think that any of "Blanche's" set would have quitted a shooting party
because he was asked to drink champagne out of a claret glass, as in
the picture of the young super-snob in 1908.</p>

<em>démodé</em> music."</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Paint and "Pekies"</em></div>

<p>Horse-play as an integral part of the modern idea of pleasure is
satirized in 1910 in a series of suggestions for new "Side-shows"
at Exhibitions, which should combine the maximum amount of motion,
discomfort, and even danger to life and limb. The recrudescence of
"beauty doctors" is noted by "Blanche" in the same year, and the
increasing use of paint, not to repair the ravages of age, but to
lend additional lustre to the bloom of youth, is faithfully recorded
by <em>Punch's</em> artists in the decade before the war. Bridge&mdash;to which
<em>Punch</em> had paid a negative homage on the ground that it kept the
drawing-room ballad-monger and the parlour-tricksters at bay&mdash;had
ousted whist, and in 1913 was threatened by "Coon-Can." On the cult of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
the "Peky-Peky" <em>Punch</em> spoke with two voices, for while he deprecated
the infatuation of their owners, he was fully alive to the charm, the
intelligence, and the courage of these picturesque little Orientals.</p>

<p>Extravagance invariably leads to reaction; but in this period the
reactions were not always sincere&mdash;at least not among the "Smart Set."
They intermittently played at being serious, but the motive generally
savoured of materialism: they were more concerned with conserving
their bodies than with saving their souls. It was an age of new and
strange Diets and Cures and food-fads. <em>Punch's</em> "Health Seeker's <em>Vade
Mecum</em>" in 1893 reflects modern pessimism and uncertainty. In 1904, in
"Our Doctors," he recalls Mr. Gladstone's tribute to Sir Andrew Clark,
but his appreciation and eulogy of medical worthies was a good deal
discounted by his linking the names of Jenner and Gull with those of
Morell Mackenzie and Robson Roose. Neurotics were now to be found in
unexpected quarters. In 1899 Phil May has a picture of an admiral kept
awake all night by a butterfly that went flopping about his room.</p>

<p>The movement for learning "First Aid" had already become
fashionable&mdash;and to that extent futile&mdash;and in 1901, in "Courtship
<em>à la</em> Galton," <em>Punch</em> mildly satirizes the creed of Eugenics, as
illustrated by the union of two Galtonites, despising sentiment, but
possessing diplomas of matrimonial fitness. Romance and Hygiene seldom
go hand-in-hand. The "Simple Life" was another favourite cult and
catchword; but its votaries were for the most part "affecting to seem
unaffected."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Smart Simplicity</em></div>

<p>American visitors flooded London for the Coronation of 1902, and
<em>Punch</em> makes good play with a statement in a weekly review that "the
old-world simplicity of rural life is unique and has an unfailing charm
for our Transatlantic visitors." This was and is true of the best of
them, but <em>Punch</em> turned the announcement to legitimate ridicule in
"Arcady, Ltd.," with its "faked" rusticity, carefully rehearsed and
organized to cater for the taste of wealthy explorers. The cry of "Back
to the Land" is illustrated in the futile efforts of fashionables
pretending to assist in the harvest field: it is ironically commended
in 1906 to exhausted <em>débutantes</em> as the best form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span> cure for the
fatigues of the London season. The "Simple Life," as practised by
well-to-do dyspeptics and the unindustrious rich, was in his view a
complete fraud, for they were really preoccupied with the material side
of existence. Hence the adoption of weird unknown foods and clothing.
In 1910 "Blanche" gives us to understand that the craze for abstinence
had even invaded the "Smart Set":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A good many people are going in for the No-food cult, the Dick
Flummerys among others. Indeed, dinners and suppers seem to be by
way of becoming extinct functions. Dick says that till you've been
without food for a week you don't know what you're really capable
of. I don't think that would be a very reassuring thing to hear from
anyone looking as wild and haggard as Dick does now, if one happened
to be <em>tête-à-tête</em> with, him and some knives! Dotty tells me that,
with their tiny house and small means, they find entertaining much
easier now they belong to the No-food set. Their little rooms will
hold <em>twice</em> as many no-fooders as ordinary people, she says, and then
there's no expense of feeding 'em. No, indeed. At the Flummerys', when
your partner asks, "What shall I get you?" he merely adds, "<em>Hot</em> or
<em>cold</em> water?"</p></blockquote>

<p>In general, however, these rigours were confined to intellectual or
pseudo-intellectual coteries, of which a good representative is to be
found in the hatless and sandalled youth depicted in May, 1912&mdash;not
unnaturally classed as a tramp by the old Highland shepherd&mdash;who
evidently belongs to the type ingeniously described as that of the
"Herbaceous Boarder." In 1913, in "a chronicle of Cures, with the
Biography of a Survivor," <em>Punch</em> briefly traces the progress of fads
in food, drink and hygiene in the past half-century. He begins with
light sherry, goes on with Gladstone claret, deviates into the water
cure, takes to whisky and soda, then to cocoa nibs, and winds up with
paraffin. Simultaneously and successively the survivor abandons "prime
cuts" for vegetarianism; relapses to carnivorous habits under the
auspices of Salisbury (the apostle of half-cooked beef and hot-water)
and Fletcher (who found salvation in chewing); then took to Plasmon
with Eustace Miles, lactobacilline in accordance with the prescription
of Metchnikoff, and finally developed into a full-blown disciple of
osteopathy. The list is not by any means complete, for no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> mention is
made of Dr. Haig or of China tea, or the uncooked vegetable cure. But
it will serve as a rough survey of the romance and reality of modern
dietetics.</p>

<p>When I said that smart people were more concerned with their bodies
than their souls, this must not be taken to imply a complete
disregard for the things of the spirit. We hear little in <em>Punch</em> of
Spiritualism, but a certain amount about occultism. "Auras" and their
colours and meanings were attracting attention in 1903, and in 1906
the "mascot" craze had reached such a pitch that <em>Punch</em> was moved to
intervene. If, he contends, we <em>must</em> have mascots, they had better
be duly examined and licensed. The "Smart Set," again, always anxious
to advertise their worship of pleasure, were not immune from the
denunciations of popular preachers. The fiery fulminations of Father
Bernard Vaughan did not escape <em>Punch's</em> amused notice. In 1907 the
results of this crusade are foreshadowed in a series of pictures in
which the "Smart Set" are exhibited as converts to decorum, simplicity
and sanity. They have taken to serious pursuits&mdash;part-singing and
photography. They frequent cheap restaurants and, as motorists, develop
an unfamiliar consideration for the foot passenger. The irony and
scepticism underlying these forecasts is further shown in the burlesque
"Wise Words on Wedlock" by "Father Vaughan Tupper," in the following
year&mdash;a string of extracts from his "great sermon," in which worldly
wisdom is mixed with sonorous platitudes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Caste and "The Social Fetish"</em></div>

<p>While complaints of the decline of manners are constant, evidences
frequently recur of the worship of "good form" and the efforts made to
keep it up. In 1900 <em>Punch</em> pillories an advertisement which offered
coaching to "strangers, colonials, Americans and foreigners on matters
of high English etiquette and fashion"; but in the same year it
requires a certain amount of reading between the lines to dissociate
<em>Punch</em> from the sentiments expressed in the verses on Caste:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">"Kind hearts are more than coronets,"</p>
<p class="i2">I know this must of course be true;</p>
<p class="i0">It is the same old sun that sets</p>
<p class="i2">On high and low, that rises too.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
<p class="i0">What matters it for whom you buy</p>
<p class="i2">The ring of diamonds and pearls,</p>
<p class="i0">A maid whose birth is none too high,</p>
<p class="i2">Or daughter of a hundred earls?</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">If you're content that she should be&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Well, not exactly as you are,</p>
<p class="i0">The trifling difference in degree</p>
<p class="i2">May only very seldom jar.</p>
<p class="i0">Intolerance we should suppress,</p>
<p class="i2">An attribute of fools and churls,</p>
<p class="i0">Yet I prefer, I must confess,</p>
<p class="i2">The daughter of a hundred earls.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>It may, perhaps, be fair to regard this as a piece of impersonation&mdash;a
point of view&mdash;rather than an editorial pronouncement. Anyhow,
<em>Punch</em> was perfectly sound in his ridicule of the aristocratic
pseudo-Socialist who wished to have it both ways, and of the
gullibility or snobbery of reporters who ministered to her vanity.
Suburban pretensions to smartness are also chaffed in the picture of
the mother rebuking her daughter for relapsing to "Pa" and "Ma" instead
of calling her parents "Pater" and "Mater."</p>

<p>What <em>Punch</em> could not stand, and to his credit never had stood, was
the inverted snobbery of those who professed to despise the privileges
and the shibboleths of rank, while all the time they took the utmost
pains to let you know that they belonged to the class which claimed
those privileges and that they were incapable of violating its
shibboleths. This old game, revived with considerable skill by Lady
Grove in her treatise on The Social Fetish, in which great stress is
laid on the test of pronunciation, was mercilessly exposed in its true
colours by <em>Punch</em> in 1907. The article is an extremely workmanlike,
polite, but damaging criticism of an odious but ancient habit&mdash;that
of running with the hare and hunting with the hounds. Another old
custom&mdash;the mutual abuse in public of politicians who were bosom
friends in private&mdash;was revived with such gusto in these years as to
elicit <em>Punch's</em> comment of "Pals before Party."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<a href="images/i_261.png">

<p class="center">PALS BEFORE PARTY</p>
<p><span class="smcap">M.P.'s Wife</span>: "I say, Archie, it's a shame to abuse poor Roddy

although he <em>is</em> on the other side."</p>
<p>M.P.: "My dear girl, that's nothing to what he's going to say about
me to-morrow. He's shown me his speech, and I'm jotting down a few
additional epithets for him to stick in."</p>
</div>

<p>Though manners were in a state of flux, etiquette still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> survived.
The orthodox horror felt by the smart man about town at anyone of his
own class carrying a parcel in the streets was, if <em>Punch</em> is to be
believed, still prevalent in 1908; the characteristic British avoidance
of sentiment is illustrated a year later in the salutation, "Hallo! old
man. How are you, and how are your people, and all that sort of silly
rot?" Characteristic, again, of British understatement is the reply
of a V.C. to the question, "Say, how did you get that el'gant little
cross?" put to him by a fair American: "Oh, I dunno. Pullin' some silly
rotter out of a hole." The change that had come over the relations
between Society and professional actors, musicians and authors is
shown in the picture of the long-haired genius who remarks, "And is
this the first time you've met me, Duchess?" The Duchess is reduced to
speechlessness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> and takes refuge in a petrifying stare. That was in
1908, and the picture forms a good pendant to the affable Duchess of Du
Maurier, who in a similar position had remarked: "You must really get
someone to introduce you to me." Writing on the necessary attributes of
a Lion of the Season in 1899, <em>Punch</em> placed an interesting personality
first: literary lions were no longer popular, as most people now wrote
books. Pursuing the inquiry farther, he gives special preference to
travellers and athletes:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Social Lions</em></div>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Q.</em> Then what is the best mode of becoming a Lion?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> By discovering a new continent or suffering imprisonment amongst
cannibals for five or six years.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> And what is the reward of such a time of misery?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> A fortnight's <em>fêting</em> in Belgravia and Mayfair.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Is this sufficient?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> More than enough. The fawning of Society begins to pall after a
week's experience of its cloying sweetness.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Is there any celebrity other than literary or exploratory capable
of securing the attention of Mrs. Leo Hunter and her colleagues?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Prowess in the cricket field is a recognized path to social
success.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> And has not an amateur cricketer an advantage over other
competitors for fashionable fame?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes; he can claim his days for matches and his nights for rest.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> From the tone of your last answer it would seem that you do not
consider the lot of a Society Lion a happy one?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> You are right; but the <em>fêted</em> one has the satisfaction of
knowing that the fevered notoriety of a brief season is usually
followed by the restful obscurity of a long lifetime.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is enough, by way of explanation, to add that when <em>Punch</em> wrote,
the names of Mr. Walter Savage Landor and M. de Rougemont were on every
lip. Fifteen years later, actors, boxers and, above all, dancers, male
and female, were the favourite quarry of social lion-hunters. There was
nothing very new about this tendency: it was as old as ancient Athens
and had its roots in the everlasting human love of variety, in the
desire at all costs to escape from dullness and routine. In 1909 a girl
at Bristol who attempted to commit suicide received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> eighteen offers
of marriage, and the <em>Daily Chronicle</em> reported that Mme. Steinheil,
on the mere suspicion of having murdered her husband, was receiving
similar proposals every day. This was at a time when, according to
the same journal, there were thousands of young women in Bristol with
certificates of competency as teachers, wives, and scholars, many of
whom could not find husbands. <em>Punch</em> enlarges on this theme with
philosophical irony. Security and respectability were apt to be dreary
and monotonous, and it must at least be lively to be married to a
poisoner.</p>

<p>Turning back to the minor etiquette of Mode, we note that by 1903
evening dress was no longer insisted on in the more expensive seats
at the theatres, though in 1906 the <em>Lancet</em> was alleged to have
recommended evening dress as indicative of "tone" and conducive to
hygiene. <em>Punch</em> had long before declaimed against the tyranny of
paying "calls." In 1907 he alludes to the practice as obsolete, and
suggests that ladies, instead of having "At Home" days, should be out
on certain days, so as to give their friends a safe opportunity for
leaving cards.</p>

<p><em>Punch</em> had for many years ceased from criticizing the manners of
medical students, which occupied so much of his attention fifty years
earlier; the most serious of his comments on professional manners were
excited by "ragging" amongst officers in the Army. The protest, which
he printed in 1896, purported to come from the ranks, and is based on
the assumption that leadership was impaired when officers forgot to
be gentlemen. At the Universities, <em>Punch</em> was evidently concerned by
the multiplication of prigs. Early in the new century Balliol was, as
usual, singled out as the principal hot-bed for the propagation of this
type, but <em>Punch</em> paid that college a remarkable if reluctant tribute.
He enumerated all the different species of undergraduates to be found
there; keen laborious Scots, Ruskinite road-builders, and converts to
Buddhist, Gnostic and Agnostic theories; but admitted that if Balliol
contained all the cranks, it also contained the coming men&mdash;the men
who would count. That curious Balliol product which emerged about this
time, the "intellectual 'blood,'" seems to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> have escaped <em>Punch's</em>
notice. At the end of the last century he notes the invasion of schools
by the bicycle, and speculates fantastically on its results. As a
matter of fact, bikes were afterwards largely proscribed in public and
private schools, and the ban has not even yet been wholly removed.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>An Appeal to Santa Claus</em></div>

<p>Fashion has many phases; and children's Christmas presents reflect
the popular tastes of the moment. In 1908 <em>Punch</em> printed the appeal
of a little girl to Santa Claus to help her to avoid getting as many
as possible of the same presents. This last Christmas it had been
"perfectly absurd"&mdash;an endless iteration of <em>Peter Pan</em> story books,
Golliwogs and copies of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, illustrated by Rackham
and other artists. The sacrilegious attempt to supersede Tenniel's
classical designs naturally met with no sympathy from <em>Punch</em>, and,
what is more to the point, did not prove a success.</p>

<p>Not a few of <em>Punch's</em> old social butts and pet aversions disappear at
the end of the century&mdash;including the old "'Arry." One of 'Arry's last
efforts was to rejoice over the defeat of women at Oxford, and another
was to describe how he was teaching his "best girl" how to pedal. The
"Twelve Labours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> of 'Arry," as depicted by Phil May in the Almanack for
1896, in which he is seen on the rink, the river, hunting, shooting,
driving tandem, boxing, playing cricket, golfing, bicycling, etc.,
introduce a new type indistinguishable from the "new rich" in dress
and deportment. The new type of tourist depicted in 1912 lacks the
exuberance of the old, and his <em>nil admirari</em> attitude is attributed to
the "educative" influence of the "pictures."</p>

<h2><a name="FASHION_IN_DRESS" id="FASHION_IN_DRESS">FASHION IN DRESS</a></h2>

<p>From the very earliest times the evolution of dress has been governed
by two contending principles&mdash;Protection and Decoration; and the
student of "primitive culture" will find these principles asserting
themselves even in our own highly sophisticated times. One need not be
an expert in psycho-analysis to trace in modern fashions the survival
of the primitive instinct of decoration or the conflict between the
irrational and the rational selves which is writ large in the annals of
Mode. Profoundly conscious of my own incompetence to deal adequately
with this fascinating and momentous subject, I nevertheless venture to
submit that Laxity is the outstanding feature or "note" of the period
now under review. It is an ambiguous term, but none the less suitable
on that account, for laxity in its original sense implies a looseness
which conduces to comfort, while, in its later and ethical use, it
stands for irregularity, extravagance and eccentricity. Both meanings
are richly exemplified in the fashions which prevailed in the years
1892-1914; but it must be admitted that, on the score of a wise laxity,
man was more "rational" than woman in endeavouring to reconcile the
claims of comfort and adornment. Women's dress is far more various,
interesting, amusing and even exciting, but on the principle that one
should keep one's cake for the end, I prefer to begin with the mere
bread-and-butter of male costume. <em>Punch</em>, as my readers may remember,
had in his earlier days inveighed against the rigidity and discomfort
of men's dress, the tyranny of the top-hat and the strangulation of
tight-fitting collars. In middle age, we find him more of a stickler
for propriety of costume. Thus in 1893 he describes, with affected
amazement, the strange garb adopted by fashionable young men for
their morning exercise in the Park between nine and eleven&mdash;a straw
hat worn on the back of the head, an unbuttoned coat, no waistcoat
and flannel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span> trousers. Simultaneously one of his artists depicts
the strange and casual attire of M.P.s in the House of Commons in
August&mdash;tweeds and knickerbockers, sombreros, caps, and even blazers.
Yet, with an inconsistency which did credit to his humane instincts,
<em>Punch</em>, at the close of the same year, assails the high stiff collar
worn by young men of fashion and refrains, in 1894, from any serious
comment on an article in the <em>Scotsman</em> on the laxity of costume
characteristic of modern Oxford. "Straw hats and brown boots appear to
abound everywhere," while "bowlers" were gradually discarded. When the
centenary of the top-hat arrived in 1897, <em>Punch</em> suggested that its
abolition would be a suitable way of celebrating the year of Jubilee.
But the "top-hat" had its defenders as well as detractors, and the
"pros" and "cons" of the correspondence in <em>The Times</em> are admirably
summed up in <em>Punch's</em> article:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It would be advisable, or inadvisable, as the case may be, to abolish
It in the Jubilee Year.</p>

<p>Because all the scarecrows in the country are already fitted.</p>

<p>Because It is the hall-mark of human dignity, and, combined with a
smile, is sufficient by Itself, without any other costume, to stamp
the wearer as one of Nature's Noblemen, whether he be a Missing Link
or a King of the Cannibal Islands.</p>

<p>Because It is indispensable, as part of the stock-in-trade of
conjurers, for the production of live rabbits, pots of flowers,
interminable knotted handkerchiefs, and other useful and necessary
articles.</p>

<p>Because no Harrow boy is happy till he gets It.</p>

<p>Because It is a decided protection in a street fight, or when you fall
out hunting or coming home late from the Club.</p>

<p>Because It only needs to be carefully sat on to make an excellent and
noiseless substitute for the concertina.</p>

<p>Because no self-respecting Guy, Bridegroom, or 'Bus-driver is ever
seen without one.</p>

<p>Because It is a very effective counterpart of the Matinée hat at
Lord's, and similar gatherings.</p>

<p>Because, to be at all in the fashion, and to look decently dressed,
you require a fresh one every day. This is good for the trade.</p>

<p>Because It stimulates the manufacture of umbrellas, eye-glasses,
hansom-cabs, frock-coats, hair-restorers, and forcible language.</p>

<p>Because no one has yet ventured to wear It on the all-prevalent
bicycle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>Because no statue has ever had the face to sport It, with very few
deplorable exceptions.</p>

<p>Because It is really the most becoming headgear hitherto devised.</p>

<p>Because It is really the most unbecoming headgear hitherto devised.</p>

<p>Because, after a hundred years, it is time we had a change.</p>

<p>Because, when a thing has been running for a century, it is a pity to
abolish It.</p>

<p>Because, if It is abolished, the custom of raising It to ladies will
perish as well, and there will follow the Extinction of Manners
for Men, the Decadence of Church Parade, the General Cutting of
Acquaintances, the re-introduction of Thumb-biting, Nose-pulling,
Duelling, and Civil War, the disappearance of Great Britain as a
first-class Power, the establishment of a Reign of Terror, and much
inconvenience.</p>

<p>Because I have recently purchased an Extra Special Loyal and
Up-to-Date Jubilee Tile, which I hope to wave, throw up, and generally
smash and sacrifice on the Great Occasion.</p>

<p>But that is not another story.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Fashions in Hats</em></div>

<p><em>Punch</em> had already referred to Its disuse on the cricket field. The
mention of statues in top-hats is not an effort of imagination: Dr.
Grigor, to whom Nairn owes so much of its popularity as a health
resort, is thus attired in the stone effigy of him which stands in the
centre of the town. The tall hat, though now seldom seen except at
weddings and funerals, has survived its centenary; but new fashions in
headgear date from 1897, when <em>Punch's</em> "Stifled Stockbroker" rejoices,
when the thermometer stood at ninety in the shade, in the relief
afforded by his Panama and Pyjamas.</p>

<p>The appearance of the Homburg Hat is chronicled in 1900, but not in
a complimentary manner. "Bertie's new hat," according to a satirical
young lady, "looks as though somebody had begun excavating to find his
brains, and had given it up in despair." There was another heat wave
this year, and <em>Punch</em> notices that straw hats were worn at Sandown,
while the horses in Paris were "wearing straw bonnets to protect them
from the heat," a practice adopted in subsequent years in London. The
"boom" in sandals in 1901 belongs more to Hygiene than to Fashion, but,
if <em>Punch</em> is to be believed, it was not confined to health cranks and
children; and in the Sapphic stanza of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> Canning's "Needy Knife-grinder"
he gives voice to the indignant protest of the London shoeblack.
Another sartorial centenary, that of trousers, fell in the year 1902,
but <em>Punch's</em> appeal to the poets to celebrate it in song remained
unanswered. Meanwhile a young peer was credited by a society journal
with the intention of forming a League in order to differentiate men's
evening dress from that of a waiter, but <em>Punch</em> failed to see in the
venture any sign of <em>noblesse oblige</em>. By 1902 the Panama Hat had been
vulgarized by 'Appy 'Arry; and a year later <em>Punch</em> speaks of "the late
Panamania." It had gone out of fashion in New York, being superseded by
the ordinary stiff straw hat, and <em>Punch</em> anticipated that the "slump"
would also cross the Atlantic.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Novelties v. Revivals</em></div>

<p>There is one grand distinction between men and women in regard to
dress. Women (or those who dictate their fashions) are divided between
novelties and revivals, and the revivals are generally of the most
outrageous absurdities. It is otherwise with the simple male. He deals
far less in revivals, and when he hits upon a good novelty he generally
sticks to it. In this category I would unhesitatingly include the brown
boot, to which <em>Punch</em> devoted the following instructive article,
modelled on the style of the <em>Daily Mail</em>, in the year 1903:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">THE CULT OF THE BROWN BOOT</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No serious student of dermatology can have avoided noticing the
enormous increase in the use of brown boots in the last quarter of a
century. In 1879 a clubman would no more have thought of walking down
Pall Mall in brown boots than of flying. But now even archdeacons
frequent the Athenæum Club in that ubiquitous footwear.</p>

<p>Necessity is probably the mother of invention, as Lord Avebury has
pointedly remarked, and the introduction of the brown boot is due,
according to a well-known Bond Street maker, to the exigencies
of a retired General, who, finding it difficult to get his boots
adequately blacked at his chambers, suggested, as a solution of his
embarrassment, that it might be possible to devise a form of boot
in which blacking could be entirely dispensed with. The example at
once provoked imitation, and now it is estimated by Dr. Nicholson
Roberts in the <em>Bootman</em> that in London alone 1,250,000 pairs of
tawny-coloured footgear are sold in the year.</p>

<p>Boots, it may not be generally known, are made from the hides of
various animals, terrestrial and marine. The skin is removed after the
animal has been slaughtered, not before, and is then subjected to a
variety of preliminary processes of a mollifying character, of which
the most important is that of tanning. Tan, or tannin, as it is more
correctly called, is a substance of a friable texture and a highly
pronounced but hygienic odour. It is principally found in Indian
tea, whence it is extracted by machinery especially designed for the
purpose, and stored in tanyards. It is also occasionally used to
deaden the sound of traffic and provide equestrians with a substratum
calculated to minimize the wear and tear of their horses' hoofs. Dogs
of certain breeds are also technically described as being "black and
tan."</p>

<p>The process of bootmaking, of which the headquarters is at
Northampton, will be familiar to all who have attended the
performances of Wagner's opera <em>Die Meistersinger</em>. It involves
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span> use of powerful cutting instruments, cobbler's wax, needles,
thread, and other implements, and the principal terms in its somewhat
extensive terminology are vamp, welt, upper leathers, and nether sole.
Bootmakers, like tailors, commonly sit cross-legged at their work, and
hold pronounced political views; hence the term freebooter. But it has
been noted that the makers of brown boots incline to Liberal Unionism.
Their patron saint is Giordano Bruno, and in theology they affect
latitudinarianism.</p>

<p>The term "brown boots," it should also be noted, is a misnomer, as it
includes shades of yellow, orange, and russet. Army men affect the
latter, while stockbrokers and solicitors prefer the former.</p>

<p>In conclusion it may be worth while to record certain established
rules, the disregard of which may have untoward consequences. Black
laces do not harmonize well with brown boots, nor is it <em>de rigueur</em>
to wear them with a frock-coat, or when in evening or court dress.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center">THE SEX QUESTION<br />
(A study in Bond Street)</p>
</div>

<p>The information here imparted must be accepted with certain reserves,
and the same remark holds good of <em>Punch's</em> picture of Church Parade
in 1906, where hatless "nuts" smoking pipes, wearing Panama hats,
knickerbockers and even dressing-gowns, are shown mingling with more
correctly attired pedestrians. But, allowing for exaggeration, the
picture reflects a real tendency&mdash;towards greater comfort and less
convention in dress. The "nut" depicted in 1907 wears a coat with
a pronounced waist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> and highly coloured hose, but in 1910 <em>Punch</em>
descants lyrically on the announcement, made by the <em>Daily Express</em>,
that "the reign of the passionate sock is over," though a man might
"still let himself go in handkerchiefs." The poet ironically bewails
the fiat which dooms our socks henceforth to silence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">There is a power, my friends,</p>
<p class="i0">That disciplines our loud-hued nether ends.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Still, he consoles himself with the reflection that he still can wear
his heart "up his sleeve," thus recalling the new definition of a
gentleman given some years earlier in suburban circles as one who wore
his handkerchief up his cuff.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Passionate Socks and Knickerbockers</em></div>

<p>Owing to the increasing skimpiness of skirts and the cult of slimness,
the approximation of male and female attire reached a point in 1911
which suggested to one of <em>Punch's</em> artists a new Sex Question puzzle.
But while the female "nut" was becoming indistinguishable from the
male, the male golfer had come to affect a bagginess of knickerbockers
recalling the exuberance of the female cyclist of two decades earlier,
and, as <em>Punch</em> showed, exceedingly ill-suited for progress in a high
wind.</p>

<p class="center">Disastrous influence of the sea-breezes on the modern "nut" coiffure.
Recently witnessed by our artist at a popular watering-place.</p>

<p>Throughout this period whiskers remained in disfavour with all men of
fashion, though they lingered on among the elderly and the middle-aged.
Pianists, artists and literary geniuses still wore their hair long.
The value of a beard in correcting an imperfect profile was admirably
illustrated in Du Maurier's picture of the complacent Admiral in
1894, and naval officers, then and now, availed themselves of a
privilege denied to the other Service, without any loss of trimness
and smartness of appearance. The "toothbrush" moustache dates back to
pre-War days, and its popularity was not impaired when early in 1914
the General commanding the Prussian Guards Corps forbade its adoption
as "not consonant with the German national character." Waxed ends
to the moustache were now only worn by policemen, taxi-drivers and
Labour leaders. But the outstanding feature of male <em>coiffure</em> during
the latter part of this period was the adoption of the practice of
liberally oiling or pomading the hair and brushing it right back over
the head without any parting. Whence the practice came I do not know,
but it became almost universal amongst "nuts," undergraduates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span> and the
senior boys at our public schools. <em>Punch</em> did not admire the fashion,
but it must have been a gold mine to all dealers in bear's grease,
brilliantine, Macassar's "incomparable oil," and all manner of unguents
simple or synthetic.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Revival of Crinoline Threatened</em></div>

<p><em>Punch's</em> chronicle of feminine fashion opens in 1893 with the menace
of a return of the crinoline, the bare mention of which was enough to
upset his equanimity, for his seven years' war against it had by his
own admission been more or less of a failure:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">FASHION</p>
<p>"Oh, Mummy, have you been<br /> vaccinated on <em>both</em> arms?"</p>
</div>

<p>Du Maurier, in a picture which serves as a pendant to one which
appeared in November, 1857, contrasts the Misses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> Roundabout's inflated
circumference with the graceful lines of the normal skirt, but the
warning was happily unnecessary and the threatened danger never
materialized. Another revival, that of the "Coal-scuttle" bonnet,
was not nearly so formidable, but it enabled <em>Punch</em> to indulge in a
characteristic gibe at the headgear of the "loud Salvation lasses."
The mania for expansion had ascended, and the fashion of large puffed
sleeves in the same year prompted the criticism of the little girl:
"Oh, Mummy, have you been vaccinated on <em>both</em> arms?" For many years
huge hats continued to offend <em>Punch's</em> sense of proportion. In 1893
he contrasts the small flat sailor-hat worn at the seaside with the
monstrosities in vogue in London, and in 1894 I note the first of
his many tirades against the "Matinée Hat." In the 'fifties <em>Punch</em>
had derided "Bloomerism"; now he was momentarily converted to the
introduction of "rational" dress for women cyclists. Thus in 1894 he
defended the innovation with pen and pencil against the protests of
Mrs. Grundy, that "great Goose Autocrat, the Palladium of Propriety,
the Ægis of social morality," and attacked her inconsistency in banning
knickerbockers while she acquiesced in audacious <em>décolletage</em>. The
lady in knickerbockers portrayed in 1895 is a distinctly attractive
figure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span> though she owns that she had adopted them not to ride a
bicycle, but because she had got a sewing machine.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Matinée Hats and Russian Blouses</em></div>

<p>Hats and balloon sleeves occupy a good deal of notice in 1895 and 1896.
In an ingenious parody of Keats's "<em>La Belle Dame sans Merci</em>," <em>Punch</em>
denounces the use of "mixed plumes" in women's hats, and the poet is
left</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w32"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i18">alone and sadly loitering</p>
<p class="i0">While the sedge shakes not with the glancing plumes</p>
<p class="i14">And no birds sing.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The nuisance of the matinée hat had roused the ire of the male
playgoer. <em>Punch</em> compared it to the Eiffel Tower and to a Tower of
Babel on top of a garden bed. The obstruction in Parliament was nothing
to it; and on reading that large theatre hats had been prohibited
in Ohio, he was ready to admit that here, at any rate, we might
Americanize our modes to good purpose. Floral decorations had reached
such a pitch of extravagance as to warrant the remark of the loafer to
a lady wearing a huge beflowered hat: "Want a <em>gardener</em>, Miss?" Signs
of sanity, however, were recognized in the announcement that Parisian
<em>couturières</em> had issued a fiat against wasp waists, and were going to
take the Venus of Milo henceforth as their model, though <em>Punch</em> was
rather sceptical of the results of this bold move, which in his view
would cause consternation in the ranks of the fashion-plate designers.
The Venus of Milo, by the way, has in 1922 been "turned down" by a
fashionable Chicago lady as utterly early Victorian.</p>

<p>Passing over the introduction of the "bolero" coat and the brief
revival of the early Victorian bonnet in 1897, we come in 1898 to one
of the first instances of the Russian invasion&mdash;the appearance of the
Russian blouse. <em>Punch</em> describes it as the same back and front, with
a kind of ruff below the waist which sticks out stiffly all round. It
required four times as much stuff as was necessary, but provided room
to stow away a fair-sized sewing machine without detection. The "Medici
Collar," another novelty, or revival, of the year, is caricatured in
a picture which gives the impression of a "bearded lady"; while the
enormously lofty trimmings of hats are reported (on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> authority of
the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>) to have obliged carriage-makers to lower the
seats of many closed vehicles. Knickerbockers had already gone out of
fashion, even for bicycling, and <em>Punch</em> unchivalrously compares them
with the baggy nether-wear of Dutchmen.</p>

<p>Skirts were still worn tight but very long, so long that the shade
of Queen Bess is invoked to express her wonder how the modern woman
could walk at all, and <em>Punch</em> suggests a new occupation for the
London street boys as trainbearers. In 1899 the new colour was "<em>rouge
automobile</em>," described as <em>très-chic</em> or <em>teuf-teuf</em>&mdash;the Parisian
argot for the noisy motor of the hour.</p>

<p>The <em>Hairdresser</em> announced that "this year hair is to be worn
green," but the statement appears to have been premature. <em>Punch</em>
again fulminates against the persistent Plumage Scandal&mdash;this time
in a picture of the "Extinction of Species," typified by a ferocious
fashion-plate lady with a plumed hat surrounded by plucked egrets.
<em>A propos</em> of headgear, it may be added that in the Coronation year
of 1902 <em>Punch</em> issued a Proclamation to all women not to wear large
hats at the ceremony and so cause annoyance, vexation, desperation
and profanity to sightseers. His Schedule comprises Gainsboroughs,
Bergères, Tricornes, Plateaux, Lady Blessington, Rustic, Picture and
Matinée hats&mdash;a tolerably comprehensive list.</p>

<p>From 1903 onwards large bag-shaped muffs came prominently into view,
and <em>Punch</em> ungallantly emphasizes their value as a means of hiding
large hands. The outstanding feature of this and the next year is the
influence of motoring on dress. Here, according to <em>Punch</em>, decoration
was entirely sacrificed to comfort: the motorist swathed in furs is
compared to the bear, the mountain goat, the chimpanzee and the Skye
terrier. In 1904 he notes the universal adoption of the motor-cap, even
by those who never owned or rode in a motor-car. For the rest, the
"clinging style" of dress, with long skirts and long hanging sleeves,
was generally in vogue. Mrs. Roundabout fears that it would make her
look "so dreadfully emaciated," but rotundity of figure had ceased to
be the rule even with the middle-aged. Fashionable women, apart from
their motor costumes, continued to display their wonderful disregard
for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> the rigours of the climate, a trait which is faithfully dealt with
in <em>Punch's</em> verses on the "Pneumonia Blouse."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Revival of the Directoire Style</em></div>

<p>By 1904 skirts were beginning to be appreciably shortened, but, as a
set-off, fashionable women indemnified themselves by the length and
expansiveness of their sleeves:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Her sleeves are made in open bags</p>
<p class="i2">Like trousers in the Navy;</p>
<p class="i0">No more she sweeps the streets, but drags</p>
<p class="i2">Her sleeves across the gravy.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Elaborate bathing dresses, exhibiting a gradual tendency to reduce the
amount of material, are henceforth a frequent subject of illustration.
In 1905 <em>Punch's</em> fair bathers remain on the shore and never enter
the water as it would absolutely spoil their dresses. We hear less of
the matinée hat, but the enormous <em>coiffures</em> depicted in 1907 proved
hardly less objectionable to those who sat behind them; and as for
hats, the more grotesque and absurd they were the stronger was their
appeal. The new hats in 1907, with the brim large at the back, have a
sort of sou'-wester effect; and the towering monstrosities depicted at
the close of the year make "busbys" look small: Mars is eclipsed by
Venus. In 1908 <em>Punch</em> chronicles the advent of the latest importation
from France, the revived "Directoire" costume as worn at Longchamps:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Fashion Plate Heroines</em></div>

<p>Miss Maud Allan had not yet been ousted from her eminence by the
Russian Ballet and by real dancing, and the repercussion of the cult of
the "all-but-altogether" on fashionable costume is well satirized by
<em>Punch</em> in this year. By reducing materials to an irreducible minimum
this new mania, as <em>Punch</em> logically argues, was likely to be ruinous
to trade as well as to railway porters and carriers, since large trunks
were no longer necessary and a whole wardrobe could be carried in a
handbag or suitcase. Another view of the situation is expressed in the
comment of the wife of the frugal Scot who had protested against the
idea of her taking to this "awfu' gear": "Hoots, mon! Dinna ye see
it's just made wi' aboot hauf the material." Conflicting tendencies
can always be simultaneously illustrated in the vagaries of feminine
fashion, for along with this alarming "skimpiness" went the cult of
huge fur head-dresses and muffs with animals' muzzles thereon. In the
lines quoted above the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> arrival of the "hobble" or "harem" skirt is
foreshadowed. In 1910 this strange Oriental monstrosity is ridiculed in
the picture of the girl hopping to catch her train, as running was out
of the question, and again in the comment of the navvy who feels that
<em>he</em> is at last in the fashion with his knee-straps.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Perversities of Mode</em></div>

<p>The progress of fashion in the decade 1901-1911 is well illustrated in
the parallel groups given in the latter year and showing the change
from homely comfort to aggressive scantiness. Even better is the
admirable representation&mdash;it is hardly a caricature&mdash;of the old and new
types of fashion plate; the former insipid and simpering lay figures,
the latter sinister modern Messalinas. Beyond an increasing tendency
to extravagance and eccentricity and the general use of paint there is
little to note<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span> in the remaining years of this period. The brief reign
of the "pannier" skirt impelled <em>Punch</em>, under the heading of "Pockets
at last," to indicate how use might here be combined with so-called
ornament. The big-hat craze continued; the habit of poking the head
forward&mdash;noted in the verses on the "Directoire" style&mdash;became so
pronounced that "backbones were out of fashion" and an erect deportment
made a woman "look all wrong"; while the inconsistent perversity of
winter fashions is satirized in the lady with her bodice slit down
to the diaphragm walking with a gentleman in a heavy overcoat and a
thick muffler; and again in the "Spartan mother," swathed in furs,
accompanied by her hatless, bare-legged children. Lastly, on the
very eve of the War, <em>Punch</em> gives a pictorial table of the relative
importance of the persons engaged in the production of a revue. The
costumier heads the list: at the other end are the composer and a group
of authors.</p>

<h2><a name="LETTERS_AND_JOURNALISM" id="LETTERS_AND_JOURNALISM">LETTERS AND JOURNALISM</a></h2>

<p>In letters, as in life, the passing of "the old order" was already
apparent at the opening of the period under review in this volume. For
in 1892 the author of the lines immortally associated with the phrase
himself passed away, full of years and honours. <em>Punch</em> had always been
a Tennysonian, even in the days when the Laureate was still looked upon
as an innovator. He had given Tennyson the hospitality of his columns
in 1846 to retort on Bulwer Lytton, who had attacked "School-miss
Alfred" in <em>The New Timon</em>. Finally, when Tennyson was laid to rest in
the Abbey, <em>Punch</em> saluted him without reserve as the chief glory of
Victorian minstrelsy. The memorial verses are too long to quote, for
<em>Punch</em> in his elegiac moods was still inclined to prolixity, but they
deal adequately with the spirit and influence, the consummate art,
and the fervent patriotism of one who, after various fluctuations of
prestige, is even now being re-discovered by Georgian critics.</p>

<p>The vacant laureateship was not filled till the close of 1895, when the
appointment of Mr. Alfred Austin by Lord Salisbury unloosed a flood
of ridicule. In the cartoon "Alfred the Little" <em>Punch</em> depicted a
diminutive figure, standing on tip-toe, as he hangs his lyre on the
walls of the Temple of the Muses. The laurelled bust of Tennyson is
shown in the interior, while outside the figures of Sir Edwin Arnold
and Sir Lewis Morris are seen dissembling their disappointment. A few
weeks later the inclusion of the new Laureate amongst the celebrities
of Madame Tussaud's Exhibition prompted the malicious soliloquy of
"Alfred amongst the Immortals."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Swinburne and the British Academy</em></div>

<p>Mr. Austin's unfortunate efforts at the time of the Boer war did not
escape <em>Punch's</em> derision, and when his name failed to appear in the
New Year's Honour List of 1901, <em>Punch</em>, in a sardonic parody, modelled
on the famous lyric in <em>Atalanta in Calydon</em>, represented Swinburne
ironically asking:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p class="i2">Heavy with hope deferred?</p>
<p class="i0">When will he solace our sight,</p>
<p class="i2">Panoplied, plumed and spurred?</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Swinburne and Meredith, two other "eminent Victorians," both died
in 1909. Towards them <em>Punch's</em> attitude had undergone considerable
vicissitudes. Swinburne's erotic ballads had, as I have noticed in an
earlier volume, excited <em>Punch's</em> vehement disapproval. Yet he paid
him the tribute of constant imitation and parody. When the proposal
for establishing a British Academy was brought forward in 1897,
<em>Punch</em>, who "crabbed" the scheme from the outset, was not content with
printing imaginary letters from various aspirants&mdash;Hall Caine, Miss
Marie Corelli, Grant Allen, William Watson, "Sarah Grand," and Clement
Scott&mdash;but made good play with Swinburne's publicly avowed disgust
at having his name associated with a "<em>colluvies litterarum</em>" and a
"ridiculous monster." The exclusion of pure or creative literature from
the British Academy, it may be added, prompted Sambourne's cartoon
in 1902 in which a sour-visaged lady in academical costume is seen
mounting the steps to the Academy, while three graceful figures&mdash;Drama,
Romance, and Poetry&mdash;are locked out on the other side of the railings.</p>

<p>To return to Swinburne, it should be noted that probably more poems
were written in the "Dolores" stanza throughout this period than in
any other metre. And when he died in 1909, <em>Punch</em>, granting him
full amnesty for his violence in controversy, his extravagance and
lawlessness of spirit, forgot the rebel and only remembered the
singer:&mdash;</p>

<p>George Meredith was an old friend of <em>Punch's</em> from the days when he
contributed to <em>Once a Week</em>, but he was not exempt from criticism on
that account, as I have already shown. In 1894 he was again burlesqued
in a parody of <em>Lord Ormont and his Aminta</em>, which ran through three
numbers and was decorated with a portrait of the author as a bull in
the china shop of syntax, grammar and form. <em>Punch</em> in middle age
only dimly appreciated Meredith's genius, and was disconcerted by his
obscurity. <em>Punch</em> erred in good company, for Tennyson is reported to
have said that "reading Meredith is like wading through glue"; but
sixteen years later the mists cleared away, and the verses of May,
1909, reveal insight as well as admiration:&mdash;</p>

<p>Nor did <em>Punch</em> allow the minor Victorian poets and authors to pass
without homage, witness his tributes to Coventry Patmore, the "poet
of Home and High Faith," and Jean Ingelow, whose <em>High Tide on the
Coast of Lincolnshire</em> is one of the finest of modern ballads, besides
touching the high-water mark of her achievement. Professor Henry
Morley, who died in 1894, elicited the well-earned tribute, "He made
good letters cheap"; while the heroic industry and distinguished
talent of Mrs. Oliphant&mdash;for <em>The Beleaguered City</em> comes very near to
greatness&mdash;are fittingly acknowledged in <em>Punch's "Vale!"</em> in 1897.
Sir Theodore Martin, as the joint author of the immortal <em>Bon Gaultier
Ballads</em>, had a special claim to grateful remembrance from one who,
like him, had known Astley's Circus in the palmy days of Widdecomb and
Gomersal:&mdash;</p>

<p class="i0">Shooting with an aim unerring folly as it flies.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p><em>Punch's</em> loyalty to Thomas Hood was testified in a long and perfectly
serious study, in three instalments, of Hood as a poet and satirist,
which appeared in 1896. In 1899 he was moved to sing the praises
of Marryat in the manner of Gilbert's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span> <em>Captain Reece</em>; in 1900 he
reiterated his fealty to Walter Scott in verse as unimpeachable in
sentiment as it was undistinguished in execution. I think one may
safely say that nothing so inadequate to the occasion has since
appeared in the pages of <em>Punch</em>. But even when the literary quality
of <em>Punch</em> was at its lowest he was capable of welcome surprises, as
for example in the really charming verses, in 1893, on Izaak Walton's
Tercentenary&mdash;verses based on intimate and affectionate study of <em>The
Compleat Angler</em>.</p>

<p>Another Tercentenary, that of Milton in 1908, prompted the cartoon
in which Shakespeare congratulates his brother poet because every
three hundred years they gave <em>him</em> a banquet at the Mansion House,
while they only talked about a National Theatre for himself. A
Chicago professor had seized the occasion to observe that Milton,
if alive then, would be in favour of every advanced movement except
Woman's Suffrage, and <em>Punch</em> turned the saying to good account in a
mock-heroic sonnet after Wordsworth. One might well have thought that
Charles Lamb's reputation was securely established by 1913, yet in that
year a member of the London Education Committee suggested that the
<em>Essays of Elia</em> was hardly the kind of book to be put in the hands
of young women students. <em>Punch</em> dealt judicially with the offender
in two letters&mdash;one from a prudish parent; the other from a humanist
and lover of Lamb who sends a copy of the incriminated volume to his
daughter, together with a report of the protest, and some comments on
the survival of Podsnap:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Shakespeare and Shaw</em></div>

<p>The last word has an academic ring, but <em>Punch</em> was probably thinking
of George Meredith's use of it in a letter to <em>The Times</em> in 1877
when he spoke of those "whom Rabelais would have called agelasts or
non-laughers."</p>

<p>A brilliant American essayist, Miss Agnes Repplier, has recently
remarked that the Twentieth Century does not "lean to extravagant
partialities" but rather to "disparagement, to searchlights, to that
lavish candour which no man's reputation can sustain." In the pastime
of hauling eminence down from its pinnacle she awards a pre-eminence
to British critics. It cannot be said that <em>Punch</em> has taken an
active hand in this game. Even Shakespeare had not been exempt from
this "lavish candour." Mr. Bernard Shaw, writing in the <em>Saturday
Review</em> in 1896, had said that "with the single exception of Homer,
there is no eminent writer, not even Sir Walter Scott, whom I can
despise so entirely as I despise Shakespeare, when I measure my mind
against his." Whether he really meant what he said is a question
passing the wit of the plain person; but the utterance stung <em>Punch</em>
into a rejoinder in the form of an imaginary interview with "G. B.
S.," in which the criticism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> is further developed and obliquely
ridiculed. <em>Punch</em> was equally sensitive where patronage of the bard
suggested self-advertisement, and in 1901, in the "New Genius of
Stratford-on-Avon," he expressed an ironical apprehension lest Miss
Corelli might oust Shakespeare as the tutelary deity of that town. The
Bacon-Shakespeare controversy was again becoming acute and claimed
<em>Punch's</em> attention in 1902, when he published a cartoon bearing on
the issue, and followed it up with a happy burlesque. As he argued,
"If Bacon wrote Shakespeare's Plays, why, in the name of all that is
biliteral, should not Shakespeare have written Bacon's Essays?" Hence
the dissertation "Of Plays and their Authors," from which I may quote
the concluding passages:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It may be said of such an one that he is a man unlettered, having
little Latin and of Greek no whit. How should he write plays? Whence
hath he lore of law and medicine, of history and science? But there
be handbooks. And a man may learn by enquiry of another, giving to
him the price of half-a-pint. So shall the dramatist acquire such
matters as be necessary, as the names of battles and of Kings and an
imperfect understanding of legal phrases. Moreover, where no copyright
is, he may steal freely from others, appropriating their plots and
embellishing them.... Lastly to conclude this part, he that writeth
dramas must endure with philosophy the investigations of talented
ladies. Being of humble estate he must not murmur should his works be
taken from him and given to a Lord Chancellor. Being himself sane he
must bear with the lunatick fancies of others. And though his words
be twisted into crazy anagrams, and his dramas be made a source of a
scandal about Queen Elizabeth, he must not complain. Generally let the
wise man ignore the bee that buzzeth in another's bonnet.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Punch's</em> "Essay" is not without relevance in its bearing on the recent
"invention" of that highly "talented lady" Miss Clemence Dane.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Punch on "R. L. S."</em></div>

<p>To repeat what I said in another volume, the highest qualities of
the literary critic are revealed, not in his loyalty to established
reputations so much as in his attitude to contemporary writers, in his
ability to gauge the durability of their merits, and to distinguish
a passing vogue from a sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span> title to remembrance. And there was
certainly no lack of material on which to exercise these faculties in
the 'nineties&mdash;romantic, realistic, and decadent. <em>Punch</em> had already
welcomed Mr. Kipling and Sir James Barrie, and though his appreciation
of the former varied considerably in the next fifteen years, admiration
of his freshness and invention prevailed on the whole over distaste
for his excursions into politics, his addiction to technicalities,
slang and obscurity. The literary criticism of <em>Punch</em> was probably
at its lowest ebb in 1893, when a review of Stevenson's <em>Catriona</em>
is bracketed with a notice of Miss Corelli's <em>Barabbas</em>. Punch deals
faithfully with the method of handling Holy Writ adopted in <em>Barabbas</em>,
but contents himself with recommending <em>Catriona</em> to those who love
Scots dialect, which he frankly confesses he does not.</p>

<p>When Stevenson died in his early prime in 1894, a very different temper
inspired <em>Punch's</em> tribute to the Great Romancer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w30"><div class="stanza">

<p class="i2">That shall outshine the flame</p>

<p class="i0">And Pala's peak shall do yet more</p>
<p class="i0">Than the great light at Skerryvore</p>
<p class="i2">To magnify his name,</p>

<p class="i0">Who wooes Romance, yet sadly knows</p>
<p class="i0">That Life's sole growth is not the Rose.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>So when in 1901 the late Mr. W. E. Henley published his famous
disparagement of the official life of Stevenson, <em>Punch</em>, in an address
to the "Beloved Shade" of R. L. S., uttered an indignant protest
against the attack on his memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Punch</em> enthusiastically greeted the Ruritanian romances of "Anthony
Hope" as an antidote to the ultra-realistic novel, and Mr. Kipling's
<em>Jungle Book</em> was welcomed in 1894 with a salvo of puns on the
Kip-lingo of the Laureate of the Jingle-Jungle, the Bard of the
Bandar-log. In 1895 <em>The Men that Fought at Minden</em> is described as
"perhaps the most coarse and unattractive specimen of verse that this
great young man has yet put forth&mdash;a jumble of words without a trace of
swing or music. All this Tommy Atkins business is about played out."
In 1898, in the series of "Letters to the Celebrated," "The Vagrant,"
while deprecating the "orgy of Imperialism" which Mr. Kipling had
helped to foster, frankly admitted that he was largely responsible
for "a quickened sense of the greatness of our mother-land, and a new
sympathy for those who fight our battles"; and predicted that his
greatest and most enduring title to fame would rest on his verse. In
1899 Mr. Kipling is rebuked for his glorification of machinery&mdash;he is
called "the Polytechnic Poet"&mdash;slang and militarism, while the parody
of <em>Stalky and Co.</em> is distinctly hostile to what Punch evidently
considered an ignoble travesty of Public School traditions. Punch had
himself repeatedly assailed the fetish-worship of Athletics, but Mr.
Kipling's <em>Island Race</em>&mdash;with its bitter reference to those who</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w36"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i18">contented their souls</p>
<p class="i0">With the flannelled fools at the wicket or the muddied oafs at the goals&mdash;</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>was more than he could endure. Accordingly his representative conducted
an imaginary interview with "The Director-General of the Empire," who
had added some fresh lines in violent and obscure abuse of rowing-men,
and who explained that he never played games himself, but "spent all
his spare time loafing and scoring off masters"&mdash;a further hit at
<em>Stalky</em>. This mood of resentment had entirely passed by 1907, when
<em>Punch</em> depicted Mr. Kipling as "A Verry Parfit Nobel Knight"&mdash;on the
occasion of his being awarded the Nobel Prize&mdash;and in 1910 the perusal
of <em>Rewards and Fairies</em> is compared to reading English history by the
light of a Will-o'-the-Wisp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>The reviewer notes defects in style and lucidity, but ends on a note of
whole-hearted admiration:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When one considers the quality of Mr. Kipling's invention, the piety
of his patriotism, the freshness and vigour of his style, and his
astounding understanding of men and movements, why, one forgets all
about these little trifling defects and again murmurs, "Wizard."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Yellow Book</em></div>

<p>To return to the early 'nineties, <em>Punch</em> saw no virtue, artistic
or otherwise, in the movement towards unrestrained self-expression
in <em>belles lettres</em> which had its outcome in the <em>Yellow Book</em> and
the <em>Savoy</em>, its headquarters at "The Bodley Head," and whose chief
hierophants were the avowed disciples of Baudelaire and Verlaine. To
<em>Punch</em> the movement was wholly decadent. In the verses "Tell it not in
Gath," in 1894, after denouncing "flowers of evil," and the practice of
delving in the drains and dustbins of humanity, the writer declares he
would far rather remain a Philistine than achieve enlightenment by such
unsavoury means. In the same vein he addresses "Any Boy-poet of the
Decadence":&mdash;</p>

<p>As in his earlier tirades against the Æsthetes, <em>Punch</em> confounded all
the contributors to the <em>Yellow Book</em> and the <em>Savoy</em> in one common
anathema. The former, with an illustration by "Daubaway Weirdsley," and
"Max" as "Max Mereboom," himself one of the finest literary parodists
of our time, is held up in 1895 to especial ridicule. The <em>Savoy</em> in
1896 becomes "The Saveloy," with imaginary extracts and further attacks
on Max Mereboom, Simple Symons, and Weirdsley; while in the same year
in "The Chaunt of the Bodley Head" (after Praed's <em>Chaunt of the Brazen
Head</em>) the Savoy School is condemned for its mephitic atmosphere.
There was in the movement much deliberate eccentricity, much of the
cant of anti-cant, which clamoured for robust satire, but <em>Punch</em> was
more happily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> inspired in his ridicule of the popular and society
novels of the time&mdash;in his parody of <em>Sherlock Holmes</em>, which was quite
good enough for the original, and of Dodo, in which the rowdiness and
pseudo-intellectuality of Mr. Benson's heroine are excellently hit
off. It opens well with "'Sling me over a two-eyed steak, Bill,' said
Bobo." In the sequel the Marquis of Cokaleek, the noble unappreciated
husband, gets killed in the hunting field, but Bobo does not marry
Bill, her fancy man. She jilts him and "got herself married to an
Austrian Prince at half an hour's notice by the A. of C." <em>Punch</em>,
let it be recorded, was responsible for the often quoted saying which
appeared in 1894 that "the modern novel is a blend of the Erotic, the
Neurotic and the Tommyrotic."</p>

<p><em>Esther Waters</em>, compared and contrasted with Hardy's <em>Tess</em>, is
pronounced in 1894 to be <em>not</em> "<em>virginibus puerisque</em>," and a once
famous "emancipation novel," <em>The Yellow Aster</em>, by "Iota," long since
hopelessly out-distanced in the reaction against reticence, becomes
<em>The Yellow Plaster</em>, by "Iõpna," whose "She-notes" wild are amusingly
travestied in the same year. <em>The Yellow Aster</em> and <em>Key-Notes</em> were
pioneer efforts in the domain of the psychological novel, and the new
jargon is ridiculed in such burlesque phrases as "the woman's voice
came through the envelope of Margerine's subconsciousness, steely clear
as a cheese-cutter." The vogue of <em>The Green Carnation</em>, a <em>roman à
clef</em> which created some stir at the same time, is attested in Du
Maurier's picture "How Opinion is Formed":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span>: "Have you read that beastly book <em>The Mauve Peony</em> by
Lady Middlesex?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span>: "Yes, I rather liked it."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span>: "So did I."</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Unchristian Criticism of Hall Caine</em></div>

<p>Du Maurier's <em>Trilby</em> was naturally treated with benevolence, though
<em>Punch</em> regretted the theological interludes, but <em>The Sorrows of
Satan</em> is rudely dismissed as "a farrago of balderdash and vanity"; the
egotism of the author and of Mr. Robert Buchanan in belabouring their
detractors is severely rebuked;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> and Mr. Hall Caine's <em>The Christian</em>
is recommended only as an absolute <em>pis aller</em> if you hadn't even a
Bradshaw to read. This great work is also parodied as "The Heathen,"
with Alleluia Grouse and Luke Blizzard in the <em>rôles</em> of Glory Quayle
and John Storm. There was still a spice of Bludyer in <em>Punch</em>, and on
occasion he could act on the advice of a famous editor, "Be kind, be
merciful, be gentle, but when you come across a silly fool, string him
up." In later years, as the literary quality of his reviews improved,
his clemency to the new-comers approached an uncritical tolerance.</p>

<p>The passing of the three-volume novel in 1894 is noted in a Ballade not
untinged with regret, to judge from the "Envoi":&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The later manner of Henry James is rather infelicitously described in
1896 as "indifferent Trollopian and second-class Meredithian"; but
<em>Punch</em> made no mistake in the following year over Mr. W. W. Jacobs, in
whose <em>Many Cargoes</em>&mdash;studies of those "who go down to the sea in ships
of moderate tonnage"&mdash;he found a new fount of joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Punch's</em> "literary recipes" place Romance first, then follow the
Society Novel (with thinly veiled portraits from life); the Detective
Story (Gaboriau and water); and the Religious Novel. The plague of
Reminiscences had moved <em>Punch</em> to protest as early as 1893, when he
wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w30"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">That Memory's the Mother of the Muses,</p>
<p class="i2">We're told. Alas! it must have been the Furies!</p>
<p class="i0">Mnemosyne her privilege abuses&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Nothing from her distorting glass secure is.</p>
<p class="i0">Life is a Sphinx; folk cannot solve her riddles,</p>
<p class="i0">So they've recourse to spiteful taradiddles,</p>
<p class="i0">Which they dub "Reminiscences." Kind fate,</p>
<p class="i0">From the Fool's Memory preserve the Great!</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Another and a newer aversion was the parasitic patronage of FitzGerald
by inferior novelists and writers, which moved <em>Punch</em> to include among
"the things that we are still waiting, and it seems, likely to wait
for&mdash;A Temporary Surcease from Omar Khayyám." This last-named nuisance
has ceased to be so vocal of late years, but the plague of "Diaritis"
is worse than ever. Mr. H. G. Wells appears on <em>Punch's</em> horizon in
1898, but only as the weaver of circumstantial scientific romances, not
as the regulator of the Universe, and discoverer of new Heavens and
Hells. <em>The War of the Worlds</em> is parodied in <em>The Martian</em>, but the
wonderland of science appealed less to <em>Punch</em> than the dream-world of
"Lewis Carroll," whose death inspired a graceful tribute to author and
illustrator:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Magic, Megalomania, and Sham Culture</em></div>

<p>From this wonder world <em>Punch</em> turned to "<em>le monde où l'on
s'affiche</em>" to castigate the methods of Mr. Hall Caine and Mr. Le
Gallienne&mdash;the Manx megalomaniac and the Author-Lecturer&mdash;and to
the realm of blameless banality ruled over by Sir John Lubbock. Sir
John's genius for truisms had been guyed in 1894; in 1900 he appears
in a special section of "The Book of Beauty" as the author of some
enchanting platitudes, e.g. "A man's work will often survive him.
Thus, Shakespeare and Watt are dead; but <em>Hamlet</em> and the steam engine
survive."</p>

<p>This was the year of the appearance of Lady Randolph Churchill's
<em>Anglo-Saxon Review</em>, a sumptuous publication which for a brief period
revived the glories of the <em>Books of Beauty</em> and <em>Keepsakes</em>, edited in
the 'thirties and 'forties of the last century by that "most gorgeous"
lady, the Countess of Blessington.</p>

<p>Pseudo-intellectuality was one of the social shams which <em>Punch</em> loved
to pillory, and there is a good example in 1901 in the "Cultured
Conversation" of a lady who observes, "I'm <em>devoted</em> to Rossetti&mdash;I
<em>delight</em> in Shelley&mdash;and I simply <em>love</em> Ella Wheeler Wilcox."
<em>Punch</em> himself in the same year "delighted" quite sincerely in <em>Some
Experiences of an Irish R.M.</em>, and "wept tears of laughter" over the
episode of "Lisheen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span> Races." This was apparently his first introduction
to the work of those two wonderfully gifted Irish cousins, Violet
Martin and Edith Somerville, but only towards the end of their long and
fruitful collaboration did he recognize in them far higher qualities
than those of the mere mirth-provoker.</p>

<p>In 1903 he was destined to make acquaintance with one of the most
conspicuous representatives of the opposite tendency, Gorki, the
Russian novelist and playwright. In "The Lowest Depths" <em>Punch</em>
parodied the dreary, violent and brutal squalors of <em>The Lower Depths</em>,
and incidentally had a dig at the Stage Society for producing it.
It was in the same year that <em>Punch</em> described the "new curse of
Caine"&mdash;"to be everlastingly coupled with the name of Miss Marie
Corelli"&mdash;and paid them both grateful homage as purveyors of "copy":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">From cutting continual capers</p>
<p class="i2">Ev'n Kaisers must sometimes refrain;</p>
<p class="i0">But <em>you're</em> never out of the papers&mdash;</p>
<p class="i10">Corelli and Caine.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>At the time of the Boer war poets had been vociferously active. By
1904 a "slump" had set in; and in an interview Mr. John Lane, of the
Bodley Head, had declared that verse had ceased to be remunerative.
Embroidering this text <em>Punch</em> traced the cause to the material
self-indulgence of the public. People dined too well to want to read
rhymes, and poets wanted better pay:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">And this is why no bards occur.</p>
<p class="i2">None ever knows that aching void,</p>
<p class="i0">That hunger, prompting like a spur,</p>
<p class="i2">Which former genii enjoyed;</p>
<p class="i0">For all the poets dead and gone,</p>
<p class="i2">Whose Muse contrived to melt the nation,</p>
<p class="i0">Habitually did it on</p>
<p class="i2">A regimen of strict starvation.</p>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Notable Newcomers</em></div>

<p>But if verse was at a discount, new forms of prose were emerging, and
the spasmodic discourses of Mr. Bart Kennedy in the <em>Daily Mail</em> moved
<em>Punch</em> to parody what he considered to be a variant on Walt Whitman,
in which sentences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span> were reduced to a minimum and verbs were dispensed
with altogether. Another new writer to whom <em>Punch</em> now paid the homage
of parody was Mr. Chesterton, whose glittering paradoxes are travestied
in a mock eulogy of <em>Bradshaw</em>, in the manner of "G. K. C.'s" book
on Dickens. Bradshaw is praised for his splendid consistency, his
adherence to fact, his uniform excellence of style and freedom from
extraneous matter. Moreover, he is a great teacher:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The last and deepest lesson of Bradshaw is that we must be in time. No
man can miss a train and miss a train only. He misses more than that.
A man who misses a train misses an opportunity. It is probably the
reason of the terrific worldly success of Cæsar and Charlemagne that
neither of them ever missed a train.</p></blockquote>

<p>Reviews of books, chiefly novels, became a regular feature of each
week's issue in the latter half of this period, and it would be
impossible to deal fully with <em>Punch's</em> critical activities. As an
example of the frank handling of a bad book it would be hard to improve
on the notice of a novel which appeared in 1906: "Anyone who wants to
read a vulgar book in praise of vicious vulgarians should read&mdash;&mdash;,
by&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;. All others are counselled to avoid it."</p>

<p><em>Punch's</em> later and more tolerant mood may be illustrated by his
notices of three typical novels by three representative novelists of
post-Victorian days. Mr. Wells's <em>Ann Veronica</em> in 1908 is received
with guarded praise as that author's first real novel and "a remarkably
clever book about rather unpleasant people." In 1910 <em>Punch</em> shies at
the excessive length and accumulated detail of Mr. Arnold Bennett's
<em>Clayhanger</em>, but admits that the author makes wonderful use of
unpromising material in his remarkable work. Thirdly, in 1913,
<em>Punch's</em> reviewer proclaims himself a whole-hearted admirer of Mr.
Compton Mackenzie's <em>Sinister Street</em>, finding the hero "a figure to
love," and the whole book marked by passionate honesty, marvellously
minute observation, humour, and a haunting beauty of ideas and words.
In conclusion, he is "prepared to wager that Mr. Mackenzie's future is
bound up with what is most considerable in English fiction," adding,
"We shall see."</p>

<p>These views are somewhat difficult to reconcile with those expressed
in other parts of the paper about the same time. An eminent conductor
and composer has recently stated that no noise which is deliberately
made can be said to be ugly&mdash;e.g. a railway whistle or a boy whistling
in the street. So in letters a similar creed had already come into
fashion&mdash;any subject was fit for treatment if it was "arresting" or
"elemental," a doctrine that <em>Punch</em> outside his "Booking Office" found
it hard to swallow. In "The Qualities that Count" one of his writers
applied this principle to the poetry and letters of the hour:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Mr. Gosse and the Georgian Poets</em></div>

<p>In the same year Mr. Edmund Gosse had indulged in some caustic
criticism of the Poetry of the Future. Mr. Gosse had said that "the
natural uses of English and the obvious forms of our speech will be
driven from our poetry." Also that "verses of excellent quality in
this primitive manner can now be written by any smart little boy in a
grammar school." Hence a squib in which <em>Punch</em> makes disrespectful
fun of "the Sainte-Beuve of the House of Lords," who, it may be added,
has since made his peace with the young lions whom he had treated
so disrespectfully. In 1913 the cult of Rabindranath Tagore had
become fashionable. Here was an Oriental poet who sedulously eschewed
the flamboyant exuberance of the westernized Indian, but <em>Punch</em>,
while finding him a less fruitful theme for burlesque than the Babu
immortalized by Mr. Anstey, regarded his mystical simplicity as fair
game for parody, and declined to worship at his shrine. Another foreign
importation, Mr. Conrad&mdash;whom in virtue of long residence in England,
marvellous command of our language and unequalled insight into the
magic of the sea and the simple heroism of the British sailorman, we
are proud to call one of ourselves and one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span> glories of English
fiction&mdash;fascinated <em>Punch</em> in 1900, the year in which <em>Lord Jim</em>
appeared. <em>Punch</em> was a little disconcerted at first by Mr. Conrad's
oblique method of narration, but the fascination grew with advancing
years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Farewell to Mark Twain</em></div>

<p>I find few references to Continental authors, but may single out the
"little English wreath" which <em>Punch</em> added to the memorial tributes to
Alphonse Daudet on his death in 1897. Daudet's affinities with Dickens,
always one of <em>Punch's</em> heroes, naturally appealed to him apart from
the humour of <em>Tartarin</em> and the masterly studies of the Second Empire
which Daudet had seen from the inside as one of the Duc de Morny's
private secretaries. Towards American writers <em>Punch</em> was almost
uniformly sympathetic. It is true that he appreciated the earlier and
American manner of Henry James more than the later cosmopolitan phase
which began with <em>The Portrait of a Lady</em>. But during the short period
in which <em>Punch</em>, in his "additional pages," published a number of
short stories by various authors, Henry James was a contributor, and
<em>Mrs. Medwin</em> appeared in serial form in four successive numbers in
August and September, 1901. Oliver Wendell Holmes, who died in 1894,
is compared to Elia in the graceful memorial stanzas modelled on
"The Last Leaf." Mr. W. D. Howells's papers on London and England in
<em>Harper's Magazine</em> in 1904 prompt a generous acknowledgment of their
reasonableness, sanity and humour, together with an expression of
amazement at the productivity of American short-story writers, mostly
in the manner of Mr. Henry James. <em>Punch</em>, both then and afterwards,
refused to take Mrs. Ella Wheeler Wilcox seriously, and described
her essays, <em>The Woman of the World</em>, as "high-toned but serenely
platitudinous; 'bland, passionate, but deeply religious.'" Mark Twain,
on his visit to London in 1907, was welcomed with pen and pencil&mdash;in
the cartoon "To a Master of his Art," where <em>Punch</em> salutes him over
the punch-bowl and in some verses, <em>à propos</em> of the dinner at the
Pilgrims' Club:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w34"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p>Some three years later came <em>Punch's</em> "<em>Ave, atque Vale</em>," when Mark
Twain died in April, 1910:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w34"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Farewell the gentle spirit, strong to hold</p>

<p class="i0">Farewell the courage and the heart of gold!</p>
<p class="i10">Hail and Farewell!</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>To complete these American references I may add that <em>Punch</em> in 1907
made great play out of the letter addressed by an American "Clippings
Agency" to Petrarch, offering to send him press-cuttings of his works.
But America has no monopoly of these solecisms. Fourteen years later,
when the Phoenix Society revived <em>The Maid's Tragedy</em>, a similar
offer was made by a London press-cutting agency to "John Fletcher,
Esq." and "&mdash;Beaumont, Esq."<br /><br /></p>

<p class="center">JOURNALISM</p>

<p>Already in the early 'nineties the altered status of journalism and
the journalist had leapt to the eyes of <em>Punch</em>, who himself was in a
sense born and bred in the "Street of Ink." I pass over his ironical
disapproval of the <em>St. James's Gazette</em> when that journal, in October,
1892, "sincerely hoped that there was no truth in the rumour that a
paper for children will shortly make its appearance, entirely written
and illustrated by children under fifteen years of age." The project
never materialized, but its spirit has been translated into action
by the literary enterprise of our modern <em>enfants terribles</em>. The
adult journalist in the 'nineties was not to suffer from this unfair
competition for a good many years to come. Meanwhile he could at least
congratulate himself that he was better housed and paid: it was not
until 1904 that the "wisdom of the East" began to interfere with his
freedom as a war correspondent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Daily Mail Arrives</em></div>

<p>In 1897 <em>Punch</em> illustrated the change by parallel pictures of the
journalist in 1837, writing in a squalid room in the Fleet Prison, and
in the year of the Diamond Jubilee, seated in a sumptuously equipped
office, fat and prosperous, and smoking a large cigar. In the previous
year <em>Punch</em> had saluted the <em>Daily News</em> on the attainment of its
jubilee. The connexion was an old and intimate one, for the publishers
of <em>Punch</em> had been the first publishers of the <em>Daily News</em>, and it
had been renewed in the 'nineties when Sir Henry Lucy ("Toby," of
<em>Punch</em>) for a while occupied the chair in which Dickens had sat. A far
more momentous event, however, was associated with the year 1896&mdash;the
founding of the <em>Daily Mail</em> by Mr. Alfred Harmsworth, subsequently
described by one of <em>Punch's</em> writers as "the arch-tarantulator of our
times." He was certainly, if unintentionally, invaluable to <em>Punch</em>,
and even more stimulating than Mr. Caine and Miss Corelli. By 1900
his genius for discovering a constant succession of scapegoats, and
converting the idol of yesterday into the Aunt Sally of to-day, is
handsomely acknowledged in the lines "Ad Aluredum Damnodignum." Then it
was Sir Michael Hicks-Beach and Mr. Balfour, but <em>Punch</em> foresaw that
the habit was inveterate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">For still, oh hawk-eyed Harmsworth, you pursue</p>

<p class="i2">Your scapegoat-hunt from covert into covert.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>As for the test of circulation, <em>Punch</em> betrays a certain scepticism in
his remarks on "The People's Pulse" in 1903:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The account given by the <em>Daily Mail</em>, in Saturday's issue, of its
daily circulation for the last eight months, together with the
leading event of each day, ought to be kept up from time to time as
a Permanent People's Pulse Report. Nothing could be more instructive
than to note, for instance, that while the Delhi Durbar only attracted
844,799 readers, the "Oyster Scare" allured as many as 846,501; while
"Lord Dalmeny's Coming of Age" brought the figures up to 847,080, and
the "Sardine Famine" accounted for a further increase of 14,586. Or,
again, there is a world of significance in the fact that the relative
attractions of the "Poet Laureate's Play" and "Mr. Seddon's Meat
Shops" are represented by a balance of 5,291 in favour of the Napoleon
of New Zealand.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>Life was certainly made livelier by the new methods introduced, with
variations, from America, and <em>Punch</em> feelingly contrasts the drab
existence of those who lived before with that of those who lived under
the Harmsworth <em>régime</em>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Drear was the lot, minus the <em>Mail</em>,</p>
<p class="i2">Of soldier, sailor, ploughboy, tinker;</p>
<p class="i0">And worse, whenever they grew pale,</p>
<p class="i2">They had no pills to make them pinker.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>It is a nice question whether we owe more to the pink pill or to the
Yellow Press. But there can be no doubt as to the influence of the
new journalism on sport and pastime. Until then, in <em>Punch's</em> phrase,
"cricket was still a childish game and not a penman's serious study."
Henceforth the cricketer fulfilled a double function. He not only
played cricket but he wrote about it&mdash;and himself. Under the heading
"The Cricketer on the Hearth," in 1899, <em>Punch</em> publishes an imaginary
interview <em>à la mode</em> with Mr. Slogger. We omit the complacent
autobiographical passages and content ourselves with the sequel:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Well, that's pretty well all, I think, except you'll probably want
to print at length my opinions on the Transvaal Question, Wagner's
Music, and the Future of Agriculture. These will have an overpowering
interest for your readers."</p>

<p>"Here are a few photographs of myself&mdash;but it's rather too heavy a
parcel to carry. I'll send it round in a van. Of course you'll print
them all. And now I must ask you to excuse me, as it's time to get
into flannels."</p>

<p>I thanked him for his courtesy, and hoped that he'd make a fine score
in the county match. He stared at me in surprise. "County Match?
You don't imagine I've time to play cricket nowadays, do you? No;
I'm going to change because half-a-dozen photographers will be here
directly, and they like to take me in costume. And after that I shall
have to see seven or eight more interviewers. Good morning!"</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Cricket Journalist</em></div>

<p>The intrusion of the emotional literary "note" in articles on pastime
came later, and is parodied in the article (in 1904) "Do we take our
amusements seriously enough?" by Mr. C. B. F:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The frivolity of the Press is only paralleled by the frivolity of the
public. Take the light and airy way in which the spectators at our
great cricket grounds treat the imposing functions provided for them.
Suppose little (but heroic) Johnny Tyldesley runs out to that wily,
curling ball which sunny-faced Wilfred Rhodes pitches thirty-three
and three-quarter inches from the block. Up glides his trusty willow,
and a fortieth of a second after the ball has pitched descends on the
leather. With a wonderful flick of the elbow he chops the ball exactly
between square leg and point. Is the raucous "Well hit, Johnny," of
the crowd a fitting, a reverent salutation? Our Elizabethan dramatists
knew better. Have you not noticed in their stage directions, "A solemn
music"? Two or three phrases of Chopin played, let us say, on the
French horn by the doyen of the Press-box would be a better tribute
to such a miracle of skill. There are, however, elements of better
things in our crowds. Before now I have seen the potent Jessop smite
a rising ball to the boundary with all the concentrated energy of his
Atlantean shoulders, and as the ball reached the ring the spectators
with involuntary reverence prostrated themselves before it.</p>

<p>Nor do our greatest men gain the public honours which are their due.
In ancient Greece a great athlete was a national hero. The name of
Ladas has come down to us through the ages with those of Socrates and
Xenophon. Think of the sad contrast in modern England. Why is not Plum
Warner (I knew him in long clothes) a Knight of the Garter? Why is not
Ranji (exquisitely delicate Ranji&mdash;the Walter Pater of the cricket
field) Viceroy of India? There are living cricketers, with an average
of over eighty, and a dozen centuries in one season to their credit,
who have never even been sworn of the Privy Council.</p>

<p>On every side I trace the growth of the same spirit. England is
devoting itself to art, politics, literature and theology, and in
the rush and hurry of our modern life there is a sad danger that
sport will be underrated or overlooked. My countrymen must learn to
concentrate their minds on the things which really matter. In your
nobler moments would you not rather stand at the wicket than at the
table of the House of Commons, or on the political platform of the
City Temple, or on the stage of the Alhambra? Save her sport and you
save England.</p></blockquote>

<p>Modern journalistic methods are reduced to absurdity in the account of
the staff of a daily paper, who are all football players, cricketers,
clairvoyants, crystal-gazers, music-hall artists, or burglars. In the
verses on "Journalistic Evolution," in 1907, the tendency to condense
everything is specially noted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span> Leaders have become "leaderettes," and
will in turn yield to "leaderettelets"; the writer prophesies a day
when <em>The Times</em> will only consist of headlines.</p>

<p>Dasent's <em>Life of Delane</em> appeared in 1908, and <em>Punch's</em> reviewer
reminds us of the commanding position occupied by that great editor,
who was consulted by all Premiers, except Gladstone, and to whom
Palmerston actually offered office. The gist and sting of the review,
however, is to be found in a sentence not merely true but almost tragic
in its bearings on the history of English journalism:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Delane accepted the favour of contributions by Cabinet Ministers to
his news-chest, but he recognized that the power and influence of <em>The
Times</em> were based upon the foundations of public spirit, concern for
national interest, and absolute impartiality in dealing with statesmen.</p></blockquote>

door of the "Northcliffe Stores" with the legend on a slate, "Thunder
is cheap to-day."</p>

<p><em>Punch</em> had his own losses to deplore, for in August, 1897, the death
of Mr. E. J. Milliken removed a most valuable and fertile member of his
staff. Mr. Milliken was not only the creator of "'Arry," and a fluent
and dexterous versifier, but he combined with a retentive and accurate
memory "the rare talent of most happily applying past literature,
whether in history or fiction, to the illustration of contemporary
instances," and for a long time had been the chief cartoon-suggester.
A longer and more distinguished connexion with <em>Punch</em> was severed in
1906 by the retirement of Sir Frank Burnand after forty-three years'
service. He joined in 1863, as the youngest of the staff, and held the
editorship for over twenty-five years. In "Just a Few Words at Parting"
he defines the aim of the editor in words worthy of remembrance. If
<em>Punch</em> was to hold securely the position he had achieved, it should
and must be "to provide relaxation for all, fun for all, without a
spice of malice or a suspicion of vulgarity, humour without a flavour
of bitterness, satire without reckless severity, and nonsense so
laughter-compelling as to be absolutely irresistible from its very
absurdity." The precept hardly covers the higher function assumed by
<em>Punch</em> in "The Song of the Shirt," but, as it stands, had assuredly
been faithfully carried into practice by the master of exhilarating
burlesque, the intrepid parodist, the author of the immortal <em>Happy
Thoughts</em>. As for the personal affection that he inspired in his staff,
it is truly expressed in the farewell lines addressed to him by "R. C.
L.":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

<h2><a name="FINE_ARTS_DRAMA_AND_MUSIC" id="FINE_ARTS_DRAMA_AND_MUSIC">FINE ARTS, DRAMA AND MUSIC</a></h2>

<p>I have noticed in earlier volumes with what asperity <em>Punch</em> assailed
the conventionalities of academic and Royal Academic Art; how he
became, for a while at any rate, a convert to Pre-Raphaelitism; how,
later on, the exhibitors at the Grosvenor Gallery superseded the
exponents of fashionable orthodoxy at Burlington House as the targets
of his satire; and with what unremitting and undiscriminating zeal he
"belaboured" all representatives of the Æsthetic movement. The further
progress of this reaction can be traced throughout the first half of
the period now under review. In the 'nineties Aubrey Beardsley was
his special <em>bête noire</em>; in the early years of the new century the
Impressionist school, and by 1910 the Post-Impressionists, furnish
him with unfailing matter for caricature. It was not that those who
stood on the old ways were exempt from criticism. Year after year
the annual summer show at Burlington House never failed to receive
a punctual tribute from pen and pencil. But for the most part these
notices are inspired by irresponsible frivolity&mdash;a desire to extract
fun by burlesquing the titles and subjects and treatment quite foreign
to the spirit in which <em>Punch</em> had addressed himself to the task in
the 'fifties, and even later. The private view of the Academy became
for <em>Punch</em> an annual excuse for an explosion of punning, and the
illustrations were a faithful counterpart of the text. Yet criticism
occasionally emerges from this carnival of jocularity, as when Mr.
Sargent's cavalier treatment of details is noted in 1895; or when
<em>Punch</em> in 1902 suggests that the formidable congestion of pictures at
the R.A. might be relieved by hanging some of them in the refreshment
room; or when he writes in 1904:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>An interesting exhibit at the Royal Academy is a drawing executed by
the artist when he was only sixteen years of age. Quite a feature of
the show, too, is the number of pictures by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span> artists over that age
which have the appearance of having been painted by artists under that
age.</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1908 <em>Punch</em> satirized a then prevalent fashion in his drawing
of the "Problem Room" at Burlington House, crowded with perplexed
spectators dropping their solutions into a box marked "Puzzle Picture
Syndicate." When the "Rokeby Venus" was damaged by a militant
suffragist in 1914, <em>Punch</em> suggested that the offender ought to be
made to serve her term of imprisonment in the Royal Academy&mdash;a remark
quite in the spirit of his old art-critic, Charles Eastlake.</p>

<p>The oblique and ironical method is admirably employed in the dramatized
conversations of visitors to the Academy and other exhibitions. In
the sketch "Round the R.A." in 1893 the schoolmistress and her bored
pupils, the complacent Briton giving himself away at every turn to his
French friend, and the prosaic and practical person, are all drawn
from the quick. The orthodox verdict is "quite up to the average&mdash;such
delightful puppies and kittens," while the rebellious pupil of the
edifying Miss Pemmican remarks, "Bother the beastly old Academy. I wish
it was burnt, I do!"</p>

<p>From the same hand, seventeen years later, comes an
equally illuminating sketch of the visitors to the Grafton
Galleries&mdash;art-student, precious young painter, young City man,
high-brow critic, matter-of-fact lady, and the frank and immortal
Philistine only moved to unseemly mirth when his friend remarks,
"Drawing to the Synthesist is entirely unimportant in solving the
problem how the artist may best express his own temperament." <em>Punch</em>
often found himself driven into the ranks of the Philistines in
self-defence; anyhow, he always preferred the way of Gath to that of
gush. In "An Old Master's Growl" in 1895 the speaker declares that the
mass of the people only enjoyed the annual summer show; the few who
came to see the Old Masters mostly came to be seen. But the ancients
were not annoyed, it was only what they expected:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

<div class="sidenote"><em>Leighton and Millais</em></div>

<p>From the other end of the scale comes another "growl" in the same
year&mdash;that of the professional model, in Phil May's picture, against
Burne-Jones who had recently made a drawing of Labour for the <em>Daily
Chronicle</em>: "I reckon 'e'll be on the pavement next." Personalities,
rather than principles or theories, interested <em>Punch</em> at this period,
and in 1896 and 1897 the circle of his eminent Victorian friends was
reduced by the passing of three ornaments of British Art, all of them
Academicians and two successively presidents of the Academy. Of the
two sets of verses on Leighton, the second is much the better. <em>Punch</em>
takes for his text Watts's saying that Leighton had painted many
pictures, but that his life was nobler than them all:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w32"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0"><em>Noblesse oblige</em>: his manners matched his art;</p>
<p class="i0">Fine painter-skill, the bearing of a prince.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The writer alludes to the malignant disparagement indulged in by his
detractors and sums up:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w32"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Great if not quite among the greatest, here</p>

<p class="i0">Rests with a fame that lives, and need not fear</p>
<p class="i0">Detraction or the hour's ephemeral strife.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Leighton's generosity and munificence to brother artists deserved all
and more than all that <em>Punch</em> said: his fame as an artist has hardly
borne out the prediction of the last couplet. Sir John Millais, his
successor, was linked by more intimate ties from the days of <em>Once a
Week</em>. Du Maurier was one of his dearest friends, and <em>Punch</em> claimed
to have been alone, save for the <em>Spectator</em>, in acclaiming the genius
of his early work. As he happily says, "from P.R.B, to P.R.A.&mdash;that
tale is worth the telling." Millais only lived a few months to enjoy
his honour, and on his death in the summer of 1896 <em>Punch</em> dwelt on his
triple endowment of health, heartiness and power, his entirely English
spirit, his mastery as a painter, and his genius for friendship.</p>

<p>Sir John Gilbert, who died a year later, was an old comrade and
contributor. He had designed the fourth wrapper in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span> January,
1843&mdash;Doyle's final design was not adopted till six years later&mdash;and
contributed intermittently to <em>Punch</em> down to 1882. His robust and
spirited talent as an illustrator is acknowledged in <em>Punch's</em>
tribute:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">

<p class="i0">You made the daily art of common things</p>
<p class="i10">Fresh as the morning dew.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>A deeper note is sounded in <em>Punch's</em> salutation of Watts on his
death in 1904, when he recognizes the fidelity of that illustrious
artist to his conception of the high mission of Art and his well-known
repudiation of the maxim "Art for Art's Sake":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

<div class="sidenote"><em>Punch on Aubrey Beardsley</em></div>

<p>To retrace our steps to the 'nineties, it must be admitted that
<em>Punch</em> enjoyed himself more in belabouring Beardsley than in saluting
established reputations. Seeing nothing in his work but a wilful,
exotic and decadent <em>bizarrerie</em>, <em>Punch</em> assailed him under various
<em>aliases</em>, all of them grotesque and uncomplimentary. In 1893 the
famous Beardsley "poster" for the Avenue Theatre inspired the lines
headed "Ars Postera," which begin:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

<p class="center">THE DISCOMFITURE OF THE PHILISTINES</p>
<p>On being presented with artful and crafty puzzle by artistic friend.
(Query&mdash;Is it the right way up? And, if so, <em>what</em> is it?)</p>
</div>

<p><em>Punch</em> pursued his pet aversion from pillar to post&mdash;or poster&mdash;with
caricatures of his types, compared to "Stygian Sphinxes, Chimæras
in soot, problems in Euclid gone mad." Mr. Beardsley, however, was
not the only emancipated artist who came under <em>Punch's</em> lash. In
a notice of an Exhibition at the Dudley Gallery, Mr. Sickert's
picture of "The Sisters Lloyd" prompts the comment, "To be more
original than the originals is to paint the piccalilli and gild the
refined ginger-bread." By 1901 <em>Punch</em> had become much impressed and
exasperated by the modern cult of ugliness, and in 1902 began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span> the
first of a succession of travesties of modern impressionist art&mdash;"The
Garden Party," "The Picnic," "A Dutch Landscape," in which all the
negligible features are accentuated and the important ones left
out. Another ingenious series belonging to the same year is that of
illustrations of "Mary had a Little Lamb" in the style of Marcus
Stone, Goodall, Clausen, Alma-Tadema, Dana Gibson, Albert Moore,
John Collier, Briton Rivière, etc. These are executed in a spirit
of friendly burlesque, very different from the notice of Mr. Gordon
Craig's drawings, which is a masterpiece of adroit belittlement.
"His drawing-power as an actor," we read, "is only equalled by his
drawing-power as an artist"; and <em>Punch</em> kindly recommends him "to
confine, or extend, his art almost entirely to designing nursery
wall-papers."</p>

<p>The exuberances of "<em>nouveau art</em>" had already elicited the cry of the
visitor (in Du Maurier's picture in 1894) on being shown round her
friend's new house: "Oh, <em>Liberty</em>, how many crimes are committed in
thy name!"&mdash;a joke repeated from an earlier volume.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a> Nine years later
the angularities of the new "Artful and Crafty" furniture are held up
to well-merited ridicule. But it is only right to add that in 1897, in
"The Pendulum of Taste"&mdash;an imaginative forecast of the sale of old
furniture in the year 1996&mdash;<em>Punch</em> indulges in a comprehensive and
entirely damaging review of the monstrosities of Victorian furniture
and decoration: groups of fruit in wax; hideous gaseliers; terrible
chromolithographs; a tea-cosy embroidered with holly-berries in crewel
work; a kneeling statuette of the infant Samuel; chairs and sofa in
mahogany, upholstered in horsehair; a Kidderminster carpet "with a
striking design of large nosegays on a ground of green moss"; and a
complete set of antimacassars in wool and crochet. Mr. Galsworthy's
minute description of the "Mausoleum," in which old Timothy Forsyte,
the last and most long-lived of his generation, lived or rather
vegetated down to and through the War, is much on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span> the same lines. But
<em>Punch</em>, being nearly twice as old as Mr. Galsworthy, had spent a good
part of his life amid these surroundings.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Art Definitions</em></div>

<p>The principles and theory of art-criticism, as I have noted above, did
not trouble <em>Punch</em> greatly in the first twelve or fifteen years of
this period. He was mainly concerned with the robust expression of his
likes and dislikes. But by 1908 he had become slightly infected by the
new psychology of art, and by way of clarifying the atmosphere launched
the following list of definitions:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">ART</p>

<p class="center">FINALLY</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A Reader is a person whose head swims.</p></blockquote>

<p>The art critics accredited to the daily Press, like their musical
colleagues, could no longer be accused of lagging behind the modernist
tendencies of the times: they aspired to be in the van of progress.
In 1913 <em>Punch</em> burlesques the wonderful phraseology of <em>The Times</em>
art critic in one of his "Studies of reviewers," which deals with the
exhibitors at the Neo-British Art League. It may suffice to quote the
appreciations of Mme. Strulda Brugh and Mr. Marcellus Thom. The method
of the former, as illustrated by her "Pekinese Puppies," is contrasted
with that of the Congestionist school in that she "deanthropomorphizes
her scheme of pigmentation into nodules of aplanatic voluminosity":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When therefore we have to assume a fluorescent reticulation of the
interstitial sonorities, a situation is developed which might well
baffle any but an advanced expert in transcendental mathematics. As a
result the modelling of the puppies' tails is lacking in curvilinear
conviction; their heads fail in canine suggestiveness, their fore-paws
in prehensile subjectivity.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Marcellus Thom's "Sardine Fishers in the Adriatic," executed
in "creosoted truffle stick," is a masterpiece of "suppressed but
dignified antinomianism":&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Wonderful though the drawing and the interfiltration of coordinating
paraboloids are, it is the psychological content of the picture rather
than its direct presentative significance which affects the solar
plexus of the enlightened onlooker. The whole atmosphere is summarized
and condensed in a circumambient and oleaginous aura.... To do full
justice to such a picture is unhappily beyond the resources of the
most sublime preciosity. It demands the &#949;&#963;&#969;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#951; &#960;&#966;&#955;&#945;&#961;&#953;&#945; of
Theopompus of Megalocrania or even the <em>intima desipientia</em> distilled
in the <em>Atopiad</em> of Vesanus Sanguinolentus.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p>The new spirit in Art had already been burlesqued by one of <em>Punch's</em>
artists in a series of "intelligent anticipations" of the work of
Herkomer, Sargent, Leader and La Thangue as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span> executed in the Futuristic
Style; and again in Mr. Haselden's Paulo-Post-Impressionist portraits
of various celebrities in the <em>Almanack</em> for 1913. In the same year
Mr. Sargent's decision to withdraw from portraiture is commemorated
in a fancy picture of "an old Chelsea Gateway," where, beneath the
name "John S. Sargent" hangs a notice, "No Bottles, No Circulars, No
Hawkers, No Portraits." Here, I may add, that <em>Punch</em> had, three years
earlier, with the aid of Mr. George Morrow's ingenious pencil, duly
chronicled the decay of flattery in contemporary portrait painting.</p>

<p>Three notable additions to the Art Galleries of London were made during
this period. The opening of the National Portrait Gallery, in 1896, is
recorded in Sambourne's picture of Britannia welcoming British worthies
to their new home: "at last we can give you a roof over your heads."
The Tate Gallery, opened in the following year, is welcomed with a
profusion of puns on the name of the donor; and the installation of the
Wallace Collection at Hertford House, in 1900, prompts the observation
that "millions after all have their utility." The sensational
abduction and recovery of the famous portrait of the Duchess of
Devonshire impelled <em>Punch</em> to cry, "<em>Vive la Grande Duchesse!</em>" over
the "loss and Gain-sborough picture." Another famous portrait of a
Duchess&mdash;Holbein's superb Christina of Milan&mdash;was in danger of being
permanently lost to England in 1909, when <em>Punch</em>, in "Hans across the
sea," portrayed an American dealer with a bag of dollars dragging the
Duchess away with the comment: "Once aboard the liner, and the gyurl
is mine!" The peril, however, was averted, and Christina still remains
with us in London.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Tenniel, Phil May and Sambourne</em></div>

<p>I do not suppose that any of the honours which have fallen to his staff
ever gave <em>Punch</em> more unfeigned satisfaction than the knighthood
bestowed on Tenniel in 1893. The "Black-and-White Knight," as <em>Punch</em>
then called him, did not quit the "Table" until 1901, when he had been
a member for fifty years, and the public dinner given in his honour,
with Mr. Balfour in the chair, was a national tribute to a great
gentleman and great artist. On his death in 1914 the special "Tenniel"
number, with personal tributes from his colleagues, was a wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
memorial of the work of one who "nothing common drew or mean." Tenniel
was the Nestor of <em>Punch's</em> staff. When the copyright of <em>Alice in
Wonderland</em> expired, a number of artists laid hands on the text, to the
disgust of <em>Punch</em>, who regarded this attempt to supplant Tenniel's
illustrations as little less than an act of sacrilege. The situation
is happily dealt with in Mr. Reed's picture of Alice, surrounded with
Tenniel's figures, contemplating the antics of the interlopers, and
asking, "Who are these funny little people?" The Hatter replies: "Your
Majesty, they are our imitators"; and Alice rejoins: "Curiouser and
curiouser." Phil May was only thirty-nine when he died in 1903, and
left a gap never quite filled as a brilliant, humorous and masterly
delineator of street life and of modern Alsatia. Phil May, who was
the soul of modesty and gentleness, and had no enemy in the world but
himself, once said, "Everything I know I learnt from 'Sammy.'" "Sammy,"
as all his colleagues called Linley Sambourne, who succeeded Tenniel
as chief cartoonist, was the greatest pride and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span> pleasure of the Table
until his death in 1910, and affection and regret still keep his memory
green. When one compares his early with his later work, one is inclined
to assert that none of <em>Punch's</em> artists ever made more astonishing
progress in their art. And for the rest I can only echo what one of his
colleagues wrote on his passing: "While Art has lost a noble, sincere
and devoted servant, we have lost our merriest friend."</p>

<p class="center">DRAMA, OPERA, MUSIC</p>

<p>The period which began with the triumphs of the late Mr. Penley, and
ended with those of Mr. Ainley, was more remarkable for dramatic
alarums, excursions, innovations, inventions and discoveries than
any of those dealt with in my previous volumes. If one were asked to
single out the most remarkable event in British Theatrical history
in those twenty-two years, pre-eminence might fairly be awarded to
the establishment and fruitful work of the repertory theatres in the
provinces&mdash;Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow and Dublin. I mentioned in
an earlier volume <em>Punch's</em> generous tribute to Calvert's services
in Manchester, but if we except his references to the Irish players,
little or nothing is said of this decentralizing movement. Where the
theatre was concerned <em>Punch</em>, as in many other ways, was first and
foremost a Londoner. But, with this reserve, most of the outstanding
features of the drama and its presentation are recorded and commented
on in his pages. New dramatic luminaries shot into his sphere, some
of them too wildly to suit his Victorian tastes. Ibsen remained for a
while as his chief bogy and butt, but was supplanted, as a target for
caricature, by Maeterlinck, and to a certain extent by Rostand. But as
time went on <em>Punch</em> was even more preoccupied with the experiments
and achievements of native playwrights. The revival of the poetic
or literary drama associated chiefly with the works of the late Mr.
Stephen Phillips, met with a not unsympathetic reception at his hands.
Mr. Shaw worried him from the very outset, but there is no notice
of <em>Arms and the Man</em> in 1894, in which, by the way, Mr. Bernard
Partridge, as Mr. Bernard Gould, greatly distinguished himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span> before
he abandoned the boards for black-and-white. <em>Punch</em> contemptuously
dismisses the piece with two lines and two villainous puns: "''Ave a
New Piece?' They've got it at the Avenue. A shawt criticism on it is
'Pshaw! Absurd!'" It was only by slow degrees that <em>Punch</em> came to
recognize the vivacity, the wit and the originality which redeemed Mr.
Shaw's perversity, his lapses from taste and his consistent defiance of
tradition and convention. It was, if my memory serves me aright, one of
<em>Punch's</em> young men who was responsible for a poem, recited at a dinner
of the Stage Society, which contained the couplet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">And if <em>The Lady from the Sea</em> seems foreign,</p>
<p class="i0">For British matrons there is <em>Mrs. Warren</em>.</p>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>A Short Way with Shaw</em></div>

<p>Towards Barrie as a playwright <em>Punch</em> was at first much less
benevolent than he had been to Barrie the novelist, and Mr. Granville
Barker's plays depressed more than they impressed him. But for rather
more than half the period under review <em>Punch's</em> critiques of plays
were primarily a medium for jocular comment, for fun at all costs, for
explosions of puns. As a devotee of cheerfulness he resented gloom; as
a professional humorist he found himself out of touch with a good deal
of the new humour, the new whimsicality, the new wit. These editorial
limitations were made good by the oblique methods of parody adopted
with brilliant results by some of his collaborators, but it is not too
much to say that theatrical criticism was never so impartially and
tactfully conducted as under the fifth editor of <em>Punch</em>, the only one
who had never written for the stage.</p>

<p>Turning from the creative aspect of the drama to the organization and
regulation of the theatre, we have to notice two important factors, one
of which was increasingly active throughout these years. Societies for
the production of new, and the revival of old plays on a non-commercial
basis were already in existence, but an impetus was given to the
movement by the establishment of the Independent Theatre by Mr. Grein
in the 'nineties, and the Stage Society and other similar bodies have
carried it on with undiminished vigour down to the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span> time. These
activities did not always commend themselves to <em>Punch</em>, but at least
he did not ignore them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p class="center">PEEPS INTO BIBLICAL THEATRICAL LIFE</p>
<p>Arrival of Actor-Manager, Leading Lady, and other members of the cast.</p>
</div>

<p>Then there was the Censorship. The Lord Chamberlain intervened pretty
frequently in the 'nineties where plays dealing with Scriptural motives
came under his scrutiny. Maeterlinck's <em>Mona Vanna</em> was barred on moral
grounds, and in 1907 the apparently blameless <em>Mikado</em> was temporarily
withdrawn for political reasons. It must be admitted that in these
years <em>Punch</em> was less inclined to criticize these interventions when
they were aimed at the frank discussion of disagreeable themes than
when they sought to restrict the unseemly vivacities of the Variety
Stage&mdash;witness his continued hostility to the L.C.C. in regard to their
licensing policy and his comments on the Puritan protests against
the programme at the Empire in 1894. An altered mood, however, is
distinctly revealed in a cartoon in 1907 where the Censor is shown
preferring the claims of musical comedy to those of the serious drama,
and <em>Punch's</em> sympathies are clearly with the latter. Since then,
though Scriptural and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span> political plays have not always escaped the ban,
restrictions on the didactic drama, where it deals with the "social
evil," have been largely withdrawn in deference to modern conceptions
of the needs of education and the responsibilities of the State.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>English Plays and Foreign Players</em></div>

<p>To go back to 1893, the three plays which <em>Punch</em> specially singled
out for approval were <em>Charley's Aunt</em>, <em>Becket</em> and <em>The Second
Mrs. Tanqueray</em>. The nearest approach to criticism is to be found in
the notice of the first-named piece, in which, while admitting that
Penley was "inimitably and irresistibly funny" throughout two hours of
"all but continuous merriment," the writer lays his finger on a real
blot&mdash;the intrusion of cheap sentimentality. Tennyson's <em>Becket</em> is
pronounced a great and genuine success, both for Irving and the author,
who had treated the story "with a free hand, a poetic touch and a
liberal mind." The opening sentences of the notice, however, illustrate
<em>Punch's</em> insuperable inclination to succumb to frivolity. "<em>Becket</em>
has beaten the record": and he goes on to speculate how Thomas à Becket
would have beaten <em>The Record</em> if that paper had existed in his time
and had ventured to criticize him.</p>

<p><em>The Second Mrs. Tanqueray</em> might be too strong meat for the young
person, but it "marked an epoch in our dramatic annals," it was "every
inch a play," and revealed in Mrs. Patrick Campbell an actress of
exceptional gifts. There is a delightful burlesque of Ibsen in "Pill
Doctor Herdal," but <em>Punch</em> did not leave well alone, and in another
number furiously denounced <em>The Master Builder</em> (which he had read but
not seen). "Of all the weak-kneed, wandering, effeminate, unwholesome,
immoral, dashed rot (to quote Lord Arthur Pomeroy in <em>The Pantomime
Rehearsal</em>) this is the weak-kneed-est," and so on in the superlative
degree with all the other epithets of abuse. This was the year in which
Madame Duse made her London <em>début</em>, but <em>Punch</em> did not get beyond a
few puns on her name. The visit of Got, Mlle. Reichemberg and other
representatives of the Comédie Française is treated less cavalierly,
and the rumoured reconciliation of Gilbert and Sullivan suggests the
possibilities of a new "Savoy Peace"&mdash;"the Reunion of Arts." Sarah
Bernhardt, Yvette Guilbert and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> Réjane were the three bright particular
foreign stars in 1894. Sarah Bernhardt was, as we know, an old flame
of the susceptible <em>Punch</em>, and though he found <em>Ize l</em> the reverse of
exhilarating, homage was paid to the golden voice of the heroine in a
graceful cartoon of "Sarah Chrysostoma." Réjane in <em>Madame Sans-Gêne</em>
comes in for high but not unqualified praise. She was perfect in
the last act, but overdid the <em>canaillerie</em> of her farce in earlier
passages, or at least <em>Punch</em> thought so. His tribute to Yvette
Guilbert, "the Queen of the 'Café Concert,'" killed two birds with
one stone, for it took the form of a very neat and witty adaptation
of her famous song, "Les Vierges," at the expense of the "unco' guid"
of Glasgow, whose Puritanism had recently aroused the protest of Sir
Frederic Leighton and other Academicians:&mdash;</p>

<p>The closing of the Empire Theatre on the score of the improper
character of the performances inspired a cartoon in which "Miss
Prowlina Pry" (the L.C.C.) "hopes she doesn't intrude." The
accompanying verses, protesting against the action of the new
Bumbledom, compare unfavourably in their heavy-heeled satire with
the verses quoted above. Ada Rehan in <em>Twelfth Night</em> is a pleasant
memory to middle-aged playgoers. <em>Punch</em> did not acquit her Viola of
a certain restlessness, but acknowledged that at times she acted like
one inspired. To the same year belongs his tribute to the "imitative
charms" of Cissie Loftus in a set of verses alluding to her imitations
of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> May Yohé, Florence St. John, Jane May, Yvette Guilbert and Letty
Lind, names that bear witness to the "fugacity" of the years and the

<p class="author">(<em>Mr. P. agrees.</em>)</p>
</div>

<p>In 1895 <em>Punch</em> waxed lyrical over Tree as Svengali and Miss Dorothea
Baird in the title <em>rôle</em> of the dramatized version of <em>Trilby</em>. He
bestowed the "highest order of histrionic merit" on Irving for his
Corporal Brewster in Conan Doyle's <em>Story of Waterloo</em>, and, in the
cartoon recording his knighthood, congratulated him in the name of
the profession through the mouth of David Garrick. Pinero's play,
<em>The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith</em>, is described as "a drama of inaction"
owing to the length of the speeches, but praise is liberally bestowed
on Hare, Forbes-Robertson and Mrs. Patrick Campbell. The popularity
of a now forgotten work of advanced fiction&mdash;<em>Keynotes</em>, by "George
Egerton"&mdash;is attested by <em>Punch's</em> perversion of the title of the piece
into "<em>The Key-note-orious Mrs. Ebbsmith</em>." The revival of <em>Romeo and
Juliet</em> served as the occasion for jest seasoned with shrewdness:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Patrick Campbell's "Juliet" takes the poison but not the
cake. Her "Juliet" has over her the shadow of Paula Tanqueray....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
Watching Forbes Robertson as "Romeo" I could not help thinking what
an excellent "Hamlet" he would make; perhaps when I see him in that
character I shall remember how good he was in "Romeo."</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Cymbeline</em> was the next of the Shakespearean revivals, and its
production at the Lyceum, with Irving as Iachimo and Ellen Terry
as Imogen, prompted eulogies of the performance and a burlesque of
the plot. Mrs. Stirling (Lady Gregory), famous in her prime as Peg
Woffington, incomparable in her old age as the Nurse in <em>Romeo and
Juliet</em>, awakened gracious memories in <em>Punch</em> when she died at the
close of 1895. Sir Augustus Harris was little more than half her age
when his crowded and in the main prosperous life ended some six months
later. The memorial verses to "Druriolanus," the ingenious <em>agnomen</em>
of <em>Punch's</em> coining, render full justice to one who began as an
indifferent melodramatic actor and ended as a successful impresario,
and throughout served "amusement's motley world" with unfailing energy
and resourcefulness. But to call him the Showman and Solon of the stage
was at once to exaggerate his defects and his merits.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Arthur Jones cannot be said to have been exactly a favourite
with <em>Punch</em> in these years. Indeed, the title under which <em>Punch</em>
habitually alluded to him&mdash;'Enery Author Jones&mdash;was the reverse of
honorific. Yet in 1897 <em>The Liars</em>, with Charles Wyndham in the
principal <em>rôle</em>, was cordially welcomed as "an exceptional play with
the prospect of an exceptionally long run." Praise from such a source
was praise indeed. The tragic death of William Terriss at the hand of
a lunatic robbed melodrama of its brightest ornament, and <em>Punch's</em>
memorial verses, though melodramatic in their emotion, are a faithful
reflection of popular sentiment. <em>Aladdin</em> at Drury Lane impels <em>Punch</em>
to pay a well-deserved compliment to Mr. Oscar Barrett for maintaining
the best traditions of pantomime. From first to last it was "very funny
without being in the least vulgar," and <em>Punch's</em> notice is embellished
by an admirable portrait of Dan Leno as "The Second Mrs. Twankyray."
In 1898 Rostand swam into our ken with <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em>, but
<em>Punch</em> took decidedly a minority view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span> in crediting Coquelin with a
"nasal victory over difficulties of his own choice." The author "had
much to be thankful for," and the play is pronounced overweighted with
verbiage which was neither brilliant nor helpful. <em>Punch</em> was much
happier in his burlesques of Maeterlinck, "the Belgian Shakespeare,"
and the travesty of <em>Hamlet</em>, with "Ophelaine" and "Hamelette," and
the dialogue, re-written in Ollendorffian sentences abounding in
endless iteration, makes excellent reading, though perhaps eclipsed
by the brilliant condensed American version of the same tragedy, in
which prominence is assigned to the members of the Elsinore University
Football Team. In 1899 the claims of the Celtic Drama begin to assert
themselves, but <em>Punch's</em> "recipe" for the construction of this new
type, founded on Mr. Martyn's play, <em>The Heather Field</em>, shows little
sympathy for the aims or methods of the new school:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Rostand and Maeterlinck</em></div>

<blockquote>

<p>Choose for your scene an Irish bog. Among brutal Saxons the
theory still lingers that Ireland is all bog, and this will give
<em>vraisemblance</em> to your picture. If you require an Interior, an
Irish cabin will be most appropriate, for there is another curious
superstition on this side of the St. George's Channel that all
Irishmen live in cabins.</p>

<p>For the subject of your drama select something gloomy and
Scandinavian. It is true that <em>The Times</em> says that "Lunacy and
surface drainage are not cheerful subjects for drama," but your
Celt knows better. Everything depends on the treatment. Did not
Ibsen contrive a drama of enthralling interest on the subject of the
drainage of a watering-place? And they say Ibsen is a Scotsman by
descent, which is next door to being a Celt.</p>

<p>Let your characters be crazy or neurotic. You will find Ibsen's
works a perfect storehouse of these, and if you "lift" one or two
of them nobody is likely to detect the theft. <em>Rita Allmers</em>, or
<em>Mrs. Borkman</em>, or that sweet thing <em>Hedda Gabler</em>, would all come
in useful, and, as your scene is an Irish bog, there is an obvious
opening for a Wild Duck.</p>

<p>If the plot of your play is gloomy, the dialogue should be even
gloomier. Irish humour would be quite out of place on this occasion.
No one must flourish a shillelah or sing "<em>Killaloe</em>" to lighten up
the proceedings, and the stirring strains of "<em>The Wearing of the
Green</em>" must be rigidly banished. This paramount necessity for gloom
will probably place you in a somewhat difficult position, and may
make it necessary for you to banish the Irish brogue altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span> from
your cast. Long experience has shown that a Saxon audience invariably
associates a brogue with latent humour, and if anybody laughed it
would be all up with the Celtic Renascence.</p></blockquote>

<p><em>Punch's</em> charity&mdash;or tolerance&mdash;did not, however, begin at home.
London dramatic critics fared no better at his hands than Irish
playwrights; witness the essay which begins "Dramatic critics are of
three kinds. They may either write about themselves, or about the
play, or about Macready." The first were egotistic, the second wholly
unjudicial, the third laboriously and tediously reminiscent. But the
sting of the satire is in the last paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In criticizing the acting of a play, you should be guided wholly by
the status of the actors. Thus the performance of the highly salaried
players should receive unstinted praise, and that of the actor-manager
(it is not the least blessing of his happy position) adulation. Less
known performers may be mentioned with less enthusiasm, and minor
personages may even be alluded to with marked disfavour. This will
lend to your judgments that air of fine discrimination which will add
to their weight.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Punch and "the Duse"</em></div>

<p>Loyalty to old favourites was another matter, as when <em>Punch</em>, under
the heading "Little Nell," pleaded in support of the "Nellie Farren"
Benefit on behalf of that famous Gaiety heroine in 1898; or when in
1899 he offered his parting salute to Mrs. Keeley, who throughout her
long career in burlesque, melodrama, and legitimate drama had never
been vulgar or tawdry, but always brave and gay, and who lived to the
patriarchal age of ninety-four. Sardou's <em>Robespierre</em>, written for Sir
Henry Irving and his company, gave <em>Punch</em> the opening for a graceful
compliment to father and son, for Mr. Lawrence Irving translated the
play and appeared in the part of Tallien. Sarah Bernhardt's <em>Hamlet</em> is
regarded rather as a <em>tour de force</em> than a legitimate interpretation,
and <em>Punch</em>, who could not accept her reading of the Prince as a
mischievous, spoilt and conceited boy of eighteen, suggested, in a
whimsical picture, that she ought to get Irving to play the part
of Ophelia. The same year, 1899, was notable for the coming of the
<em>Revue</em>. The pioneer effort, which was launched at the Avenue Theatre,
was more or less on French lines, but even at the outset the Variety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
element was prominent in a series of imitations of popular actors
and actresses. Tree's production of <em>King John</em>, with Lewis Waller
as Falconbridge and Miss Julia Neilson as Constance, is pronounced
"a superb revival," but the English version of <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em>
failed to convert <em>Punch</em> to the majority view, though he now admitted
that the piece contained brilliant poetry. He preferred Wyndham to
Coquelin, but liked neither of them in the title <em>rôle</em>, and he sums up
by declaring the piece to be a fine dramatic poem <em>not</em> to be acted,
but read. Still, <em>Punch</em> was never wholly insular or inaccessible to
new and foreign influences. He describes in 1900 how an enthusiastic
friend accosted him in broken Anglo-Italian and swept him off to see
Mme. Duse in the Italian version of <em>The Second Mrs. Tanqueray</em>.
<em>Punch</em> began by scoffing at the grotesque costumes of the cast, but
succumbed to the magic of this wonderful actress, who owed nothing to
physique, discarded all make-up, even in a part where artificiality was
in keeping with the character, and triumphed by sheer force of genius.</p>

</div>

<p>The vogue of musical comedy was now at its height. <em>Punch</em> has some
amusing suggestions in 1900 for adapting <em>The School for Scandal</em> and
Mr. Henry Arthur Jones's <em>Mrs. Dane's Defence</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span> to suit the fashion of
the hour, with appropriate casts, including Dan Leno and Miss Marie
Lloyd. His rhymed extravaganza on "The Evolution of Musical Comedy"
accurately describes the prevalent method in this quatrain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

<p class="i2">(Chiefly frivol and froth)</p>
<p class="i2">You do not spoil the broth</p>
<p class="i0">By employing a number of cooks.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>With the opening of the new century, the "poetic drama" was revived
with a certain measure of success by the production of Mr. Stephen
Phillips's plays. Mr. Phillips had graduated as an actor, but <em>Punch</em>
found him lacking in the theatrical sense, while acknowledging the pomp
and pageantry of his verse. <em>Herod</em>, with Sir Herbert Tree in the title
<em>rôle</em>, is condemned for its repulsive realism, and the lack of any
character that engaged sympathy. The notice of <em>Paolo and Francesca</em> in
1902 is long, critical and by no means unfriendly, but the resultant
impression is of "a negative achievement" in which the purple patches
failed to redeem the lack of consistent characterization or of
stage-craft. Mr. Henry Ainley is mentioned, but without any recognition
of the qualities which have since earned for him distinction and
popularity. <em>Nero</em>, by the same author, produced in 1906, is described
as "out-heroding <em>Herod</em>." There were many fine lines but little
dramatic action. <em>Punch</em> praises Miss Constance Collier as Poppaea,
but cannot take the part seriously. "She looked the Roman lady, played
the unfaithful wife, and died effectively as an invalid after a long
and inexplicable illness. Perhaps she was poisoned. Nero knows; nobody
else does except, perhaps, Mr. Stephen Phillips." Tree's make-up as
Nero was most artistic, but he had not one really fine scene given him;
Mrs. Tree was an admirable Agrippina; but <em>Punch</em> was not thrilled by
the final conflagration, which he describes as a "weird, maniacal but
dramatically unsatisfactory finish."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Barrie and Shaw</em></div>

<p>Meanwhile Sir James Barrie and Mr. Bernard Shaw were coming along with
leaps and bounds, but neither of them owed much to <em>Punch</em> in the early
years of the century. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span> nothing but praise for H. B. Irving's
acting in <em>The Admirable Crichton</em>, but it was a triumph for the actor
rather than the playwright. The hero was "a perplexing creation," and
the play "a queer mixture of comedy, extravaganza, farce and tragedy."
Even less sympathetic was the first notice of <em>Peter Pan</em>, in 1905. As
<em>Punch</em> had detected resemblances to <em>The Overland Route</em> and <em>Foul
Play</em> in <em>The Admirable Crichton</em>, so he now found reminiscences of
<em>Peter Schlemihl</em> and <em>Snowdrop</em> in the new play. For the rest, he
could find little either to amuse or that could even be acknowledged
as new or original in the extravaganza. He could not even tell whether
the children present enjoyed it. <em>Punch</em> acknowledges that Barrie was
the pet of the critics, and congratulates him on having his pieces
perfectly acted by first-rate comedians. He frankly admits that he
(<em>Punch</em>) was in the minority. A year later <em>Peter Pan</em> is recognized
as a popular favourite in a much more sympathetic notice. Mr. Shaw was
a much tougher morsel to digest, but here, too, one notes a progressive
appreciation from the days when <em>Punch</em> pronounced <em>Man and Superman</em>
to be "unpresentable," not on moral grounds, but because it was not
a mirror of humanity in point either of character or action. Similar
reserves are expressed in the notice of <em>The Doctor's Dilemma</em> in 1906.
The general verdict is summed up in the epigram that "unfortunately,
by steady abuse of it, Mr. Shaw has long ago forfeited his claim to be
taken seriously." Yet the play contains "some very excellent phagocytes
which enjoy a strong numerical advantage over its malevolent germs."
So, again, <em>Cæsar and Cleopatra</em>, while affording in many ways a
rare intellectual entertainment, was spoiled by the author's passion
for being instructive; the piece fell between two stools, for it was
neither frankly sacrilegious nor purely serious.</p>

<p>The ingenious burlesque account of an imaginary meeting of "The Decayed
Drama and Submerged Stage Rescue Society" in 1903 is in the main
hostile to the societies which confined their activities to the revival
of old plays that failed to attract the general public. But <em>Punch</em>
was by no means enamoured of all the manifestations of modernity, and
the rumour in 1906 that Mr. Seymour Hicks was going to produce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span> a
musical comedy based on <em>As You Like It</em> prompted a diverting retort
in <em>Punch's</em>: "As We Certainly Don't Like It, a Musical Comedy in Two
Acts, by Hicks von Rubenstammer and William Shakespeare."</p>

<p><em>Punch</em> adds the note:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Great care has been taken to follow the usual musical-comedy plan of
making the Second Act even worse than the first."</p></blockquote>

<p>His success may be judged by the extract that follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Irving had met with various vicissitudes of criticism at <em>Punch's</em>
hands during his career. But latterly admiration prevailed, and, when
the end came, real affection shines through the brief memorial quatrain
printed in October, 1905:&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Ellen Terry's Jubilee</em></div>

<p>Irving, as <em>Punch</em> noted in his review of Mr. Bram Stoker's Life, was
if possible more loved by his company than by the idolizing public. The
financial misfortunes which dogged the last years of his life were due
more to bad luck than bad management, and did not impair his serenity.
He died in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span> harness, and there was more tragedy in the latter years
of his contemporary and friend, the famous and prosperous comedian J.
L. Toole, for they were clouded by bereavement as well as infirmity;
and <em>Punch's</em> farewell to his friend in July, 1906, emphasizes the
contrast:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">FIFTY YEARS A QUEEN</p>
<p class="center">(<em>An Author's Tribute.</em>)</p>
<p>(A scheme is on foot for presenting a National Tribute to Miss Ellen
Terry on April 28, the fiftieth anniversary of her first appearance on
the stage.)</p>
</div>

<p>Ellen Terry's Jubilee in the same year was honoured in a cartoon;
but a new and formidable rival to the Muses of legitimate Comedy and
Tragedy reared its menacing head in the following year. The visit of
the <em>Grand Guignol</em> to London in 1907 inspired a prophetic fantasy on
the new cult of "Shrieks and Shudders" which has been easily eclipsed
by the realities of the Little Theatre. As I write these lines the
leading serious weekly, among "Plays worth seeing," includes the
"unabated horrors" of the London Grand Guignol. I have spoken elsewhere
of the dancing mania. In 1909 the <em>furore</em> excited by Miss Maud Allan
led to the following squib in which burlesque is mingled with caustic
ridicule:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">HER RETURN</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Being a wholly imaginative anticipation of the Proceedings at the
Palace on the historic night.</em></p>

<p>... Before the dancing began an ode to the artiste from the emotional
pen of Sir Ernest Cassel was read by Sir John Fisher, containing these
memorable lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w30"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Barefooted Bacchanal, would that I were Kipling</p>
<p class="i0">To celebrate thy marvellous arm-rippling!</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>... The new dances were four in number, and in them She personated in
turn Pharaoh's Daughter in her famous fandango known tastefully as the
Bull Rush; Jephthah's Daughter in her final macabre Hebrew fling, on
hearing of her father's vow and her own fate; Uriah's wife in her <em>pas
de liberté</em> after the battle; and Jezebel in her defiant tarantella
before a waxen Elijah&mdash;all new and all marvellously restrained (not
only in dress) and full of scriptural tact.... At the end of the turn
the applause lasted fourteen minutes, and She was led on eleven times.
Free restoratives were then distributed in the theatre, ambulances
removed those admirers who were too far gone to remain any longer, and
the programme proceeded. Late at night She was drawn to her residence
at Frognal in a carriage from which the horses had been removed, the
Prime Minister, Mr. Walkley, Mr. Alfred Butt and a number of other
talented gentlemen taking their places. Never was there such a triumph.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The "Follies"</em></div>

<p>Happily there were antidotes to the plague of Biblical Bacchanals;
none better than that supplied for several seasons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span> by the late Mr.
Pélissier and his "Follies," to whom <em>Punch</em> expressed his gratitude
in 1910. It was a "priceless" entertainment, with its "Potted
Plays," admirable burlesques of the music-hall stage, opera, the
Russian ballet, and on occasion, as in "Everybody's Benefit," really
acute satire of the histrionic temperament. "The Follies" have had
reincarnations and successors and imitators, but <em>Punch's</em> doggerel
is not a bad picture of the troupe at its best, before the late Miss
Gwennie Mars left them, and when Mr. Lewis Sydney, Mr. Dan Everard, Mr.
Morris Harvey, and Miss Muriel George contributed nightly to the gaiety
of the London public:&mdash;</p>

<p>The "Follies" were benefactors; their satire was in the main most
genial; and they did not cause their audiences "furiously to think."
These aims accorded largely with <em>Punch's</em> own conception of the
function of public entertainers; none the less in his later years
he was by no means antagonistic to the serious drama. In 1907 Mr.
Galsworthy's <em>Strife</em> is welcomed as a great play, greatly acted.
<em>Punch's</em> dramatic critic has nothing but praise for it, though he
did not think that the author bothered about a moral. It was his
business to make other people uncomfortable, to make them think and "do
something." "If <em>Strife</em> has a moral it is simply that the problem of
Capital and Labour will have to be settled."</p>

</div>

<p><em>Punch</em> still intermittently bewailed the decline of the Harlequinade.
His Lament for King Pantomime in 1910 was based on an article in
the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> welcoming the beneficent revolution which had
substituted <em>Peter Pan</em> for the old Christmas carnival of Clown and
Pantaloon. At the same time <em>Punch</em> had himself become more than
reconciled to the new children's idol and had compared Maeterlinck's
<em>Blue Bird</em> unfavourably with the perennial Peter. The competition
of the film play had not yet become acute, and the Music-Hall, which
<em>Punch</em> had so frequently and even fiercely assailed in its earlier
phases, was now a formidable and fashionable rival of the theatre.
In 1908 Harry Lauder's salary, alleged to average £250 a week, is
compared with that of the Lord Chancellor. There was no longer any
talk of "indignity" in appearing on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span> the boards of the variety stage,
and <em>Punch</em> notices Sarah Bernhardt's appearance at the Coliseum, in
1910, as putting the crown on the new movement, and providing the Halls
with their apotheosis, for she was "still the greatest star in the
Thespian firmament." Her "turn" was in the second Act of <em>L'Aiglon</em>;
the only other feature in the programme that called for notice was the
performance of the "Balalaika Orchestra"; the rest of the "artists"
were "very small minnows alongside of this great Tritoness." The
"divine Sarah" could do no wrong, but, when Sir Herbert Tree appeared
in the Halls, in 1911, <em>Punch's</em> cartoon was certainly not honorific.
Nor is the note of "indignity" altogether lacking in the dialogue
between the two knockabout comedians in Mr. Townsend's picture in
1912:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">First Music-Hall Artist</span> (<em>watching Mr. J. M. Barrie's "The
Twelve Pound Look" from the wings</em>): "I like this yer sketch; the
patter's so good. 'Oo wrote it?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second M.-H. A.</span>: "Bloke called Barrie, I think."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First M.-H. A.</span>: "Arst for 'is address. 'E writes our next."</p></blockquote>

<p>The "Balalaika Orchestra," by the way, was a minor sign of the Russian
invasion already at its height. Miss Maud Allan had been unfavourably
received in 1909 in Manchester, and about the same time the Chicago
"Wheat King," Mr. Patten, had been mobbed on the Manchester Exchange,
and <em>Punch</em> ingeniously "synthesised" the two events in the following
stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">The types that make the market mad</p>
<p class="i2">No doubt inspire the self-same loathing</p>
<p class="i0">In spots that spin, as those whose fad</p>
<p class="i2">Is chucking up all kinds of clothing.</p>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The March of Music</em></div>

<p>The Russian Ballet was a very different thing from the poses and
wrigglings of barefooted Bacchantes, and <em>Punch</em> became lyrical in
his eulogies of these "spring-heeled Jacks and Jills." The exquisite
romance and fantasy of "The Spectre of the Rose," the "Carnival" and
the "Sylphides" were a revelation to those who, like Carlyle, only saw
in the old opera-ballet the conversion of the human frame into a pair
of animated compasses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>The Russian Ballet furnished <em>Punch</em> in his almanack for 1913 with an
excellent formula for caricatures of the idols and butts of the hour,
but his admiration for the originals was sincere.</p>

<p>In the years immediately preceding the war the cinema demands an
evergrowing if not altogether appreciative attention. <em>Punch</em> pays a
left-handed compliment to the versatility of the film actor, but very
properly satirizes the extraordinary representations of English life
and dress in the foreign films produced for the English market. The
invasion of Debrett by chorus girls, recorded in October 1913, is an
old story, but if Punch is to be trusted had then reached dimensions
unparalleled in the annals of aristocratic condescension.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="center">MUSIC</p>

<p>Music has been called "the youngest of the arts" in view of the fact
that, as we now understand it in the Western world, it dates roughly
from the year 1600. But the "heavenly maid" had already ceased to be
the Cinderella of the Muses, though still condemned in restaurants
and places where they feed to the menial function of acting as an
<em>obbligato</em> accompaniment to conversation, deglutition, and digestion.
A pessimistic observer remarked about fifteen years ago that modern
life bade fair to be dominated by music and machinery, and the
correlation of the two factors has since been abundantly illustrated
by the momentous development of the gramophone and the pianola, the
cult of "sonority" and the dynamics of the orchestra. When to these
influences are added the successive experiments in harmony and tonality
and rhythm associated with the names of Strauss and Debussy, Scriabine
and Stravinsky, Ravel and Schönberg, one cannot deny that the ferment
in letters has been more than matched by the exuberant activities of
musical modernists. In the period under review the "whole tone scale"
was partially acclimatized and "rag-time" was domesticated, Wagner
ceased to be regarded as an anarch of discord, and the "Music of the
Future" became the music<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span> of the past. It was no longer a guarantee
of enlightenment to worship Brahms or admire Beethoven. Of the three
"B's" Bach alone has maintained his prestige, and to-day counts upon
the allegiance of all schools. Otherwise, and in spite of the renown
of Strauss, Germany ceased to exercise her old musical supremacy,
and, even before the war, Russia, France and Italy had entered into a
formidable competition with the "predominant partner" in the domain
of opera. And though opera is an artificial blend of incompatibles
and must always remain on a lower plane than abstract or absolute
music&mdash;the most transcendental thing in the whole range of art&mdash;it
claims priority of notice in this record for two sufficient reasons:
its social prestige and the amount of space devoted to it by <em>Punch</em>.</p>

<p>Wagner's operas were now established in the Covent Garden repertory,
and as I have already noticed, their new-found and fashionable
popularity was largely due to the appeal of the great singers, notably
Jean and Edouard de Reszke and Mlle. Ternina, who proved that Wagnerian
melody was all the more effective when sung beautifully and not
declaimed or barked as by so many German singers. Moreover when, as in
the artists mentioned, this vocal lustre was combined with a splendid
presence, dignity of bearing, and dramatic intelligence, the appeal
was well-nigh irresistible. I insert the qualification advisedly on
behalf of <em>Punch</em> who, in these years at any rate, was never reconciled
to Wagner, and when he heard Jean de Reszke and his brother in the
<em>Meistersinger</em> in 1897 could not refrain from jocular disparagement of
the score.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Foreign Stars and Native Composers</em></div>

<p>Verdi's <em>Falstaff</em> had been produced in 1894, but <em>Punch</em> abstains
from any criticism of that exhilarating work, merely pronouncing the
performance a success, and a few years later further advertised his
inability to recognize the supreme achievements of the later Verdi by
declaring that <em>Otello</em> as an opera was "heavy." In opera he was in
the main an inveterate <em>laudator temporis acti</em> and chiefly enjoyed
himself when opportunities arose for indulging in alliterative quips
such as "merry Mancinelli," "beaming Bevignani," or puns on the
name of the performers, e.g. "Mlle. Bauermeister-singer." Puccini's
operas&mdash;<em>Manon</em>, <em>La Bohême</em> and <em>Madama Butterfly</em>&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span> found favour
in his sight; they had sparkle, elegance and <em>brio</em>. But he was
not impressed with <em>La Tosca</em>, holding that the "operaticizing" of
successful plays was a mistake; in general his notices are void of
musical criticism and only deal with the singing of Melba and Caruso
and the admirable Destinn. Still <em>Punch</em> had lucid intervals of
vision when he saw a good or great thing and praised it handsomely.
The Santuzza of Calvé, in 1894, was "grand and magnificent" and her
Carmen "marvellous" and unique. The epithets were fully deserved, but
<em>Punch</em> acutely detected that this great artist and actress suffered
from the excess of her qualities, and wittily described her Marguerite
in <em>Faust</em> as "a <em>Mädchen</em> with a past." Madame Patti's reappearance
in opera in 1895 after many years' absence was genially welcomed, none
the less so for her choice of <em>La Traviata</em> for her <em>rentrée</em>, for
<em>Punch</em> was faithful to his old operatic loves. In the next few years
English opera and operatic composers claimed <em>Punch's</em> attention. The
scheme of a National Opera House was revived in 1899 when <em>Punch</em>
represented Music petitioning the L.C.C. for a site, but the sinews
of war were not forthcoming. Sir Charles Stanford's <em>Much Ado about
Nothing</em>, the libretto adapted from Shakespeare by Mr. Julian Sturgis,
with Miss Marie Brema, Miss Suzanne Adams, Mr. David Bispham and M.
Plançon in the cast, was pronounced "an undisputed success" in 1901.
In 1902 there were two native novelties. In Mr. Herbert Bunning's
<em>Princesse Osra</em>, founded on "Anthony Hope's" novel, <em>Punch</em> found
little scope for positive praise: it was "musically disappointing
save for accidental reminiscences." Nor was he much more enthusiastic
over Miss Ethel Smyth's <em>Der Wald</em>, with its lurid plot "of the penny
plain, twopence coloured type" and "interminable duets." Over one stage
direction, "Peasants turn pale," <em>Punch</em> waxed ribald, and he concludes
his notice with the ambiguous sentence: "Miss Smyth was acclaimed
vociferously, the Duke of Connaught and the occupants of the Royal box
testifying their great pleasure at what may come to be, after judicious
elimination, a satisfactory success." The first of the <em>Salomes</em>
who de-decorated the lyric and variety stages was not Strauss's but
Massenet's version, produced in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span> summer of 1903. Mme. Calvé was
in the cast, but the opera provided no scope for her genius, and
<em>Punch</em> damned it with faint praise as not likely to be retained in the
repertory, a very safe prediction. In the summary of the season <em>Punch</em>
puts Richter at the head of the successes, a well-merited recognition
of his direction of the Wagner performances; the list of "stars"
includes the "two Vans"&mdash;Van Rooy, the Dutch baritone, and Van Dyck,
the Dutch tenor&mdash;Destinn, Calvé and Melba, Caruso and Plançon. In the
winter the San Carlo troupe from Naples visited London, with Sammarco
and Caruso&mdash;or Robinson Caruso, as <em>Punch</em> liked to call him&mdash;as the
chief male singers, but no new operas were produced. <em>André Chénier</em>
in 1907 is described as of the <em>Tosca</em> or lurid type. A new hand is
observable in the notice which acknowledges an unexpected dignity
and refinement in Caruso's always brilliant singing and pronounces
Destinn "adorable." Wagner's star was still in the ascendant in 1908,
and Richter's splendid conducting of the Tetralogy is commemorated in
the cartoon of Hans the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span> <em>Ring</em>-master; while the "record operatic
duel" between Melba and Tetrazzini is similarly honoured a little
later. Never before, unless I am much mistaken, had two cartoons with
a musical motive appeared in the same year. In 1910 Strauss was the
grand and conspicuous portent of the operatic world, for <em>Elektra</em>,
was produced in the spring and <em>Salome</em> in the winter. The former
was hailed by <em>Punch</em> as a supreme manifestation of the <em>Maladie de
Siècle</em>. His verses are quoted not for their literary merit so much
as because they are a fairly compendious record of the fashions and
foibles of "England de luxe" at the time:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">STARS IN OPPOSITION; OR, THE "RECORD" OPERATIC DUEL</p>
</div>

<p><em>Salome</em>, so far as the book was concerned, was a tertiary deposit.
Heine, in a few masterly stanzas in his fantastic narrative poem <em>Atta
Troll</em>, tells the old legend of the unholy love of the daughter of
Herodias for John the Baptist. Therein may be found the essence of
Wilde's play, adapted to form the libretto of the opera. <em>Punch</em>, who
attended the dress rehearsal, gives an interesting account of his
experiences, but shirks the task of criticizing the opera: for that,
as he observes, "no vocabulary could be too large or peculiar." But
he mentions one orchestral interlude, in which "there was one sound,
painfully iterated, like the chirrup of a sick hen, which appeared to
come from some part of the violin that is usually left alone." At the
close of June, 1914, Strauss's <em>Légende de Joseph</em> was produced at
Covent Garden by Sir Thomas Beecham with the Russian Ballet. <em>Punch</em>
abstained from detailed musical criticism, but condemned the "vulgar
animalism" of the piece which he regarded as "a false move in every
way," and his view cannot be laid down to prudery or Philistinism,
since it was shared by many of the most devoted admirers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span> Strauss.
Nor can he be charged with a wholesale depreciation of German music
in view of the tribute to Humperdinck's <em>Hänsel und Gretel</em>, which
appeared in his pages a few months earlier:&mdash;</p>

<p>The sequel is curious, for while the gentle Humperdinck signed the
anti-British manifesto issued at the outbreak of the War by leading
German professors, men of science and artists, the name of Strauss was
conspicuously absent. And as I write Strauss, middle-aged and grey, is
revisiting London and, no longer in the van of musical progress, is
regarded by our emancipated critics not exactly as a "back number" but
certainly as very far from being the "Mad Mullah" of music. Even before
the War German operatic music had been superseded in popularity by the
Russian school. In June, 1914, Moussorgsky's <em>Boris Godounov</em> was the
great feature of the season, and to this, as to Borodine's <em>Prince
Igor</em>, Chaliapine, in <em>Punch's</em> phrase, "brought that gift of the great
manner, that ease and splendour of bearing, and those superb qualities
of voice which, found together, give him a place apart from his kind."</p>

<p>In the domain of light and comic opera the severance of the Gilbert
and Sullivan partnership, though a personal reconciliation was
effected, was final so far as collaboration was concerned. Composer
and librettist both formed new or renewed old associations&mdash;Gilbert
with Cellier in <em>The Mountebanks</em>, and Sullivan with Burnand in <em>The
Chieftain</em>&mdash;but without repeating their old triumphs. When Sullivan
died in 1900 his services to art and humanity are read aright in
<em>Punch's</em> memorial stanzas:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">SIXTY YEARS OF "PROGRESS"</p>
</div>

<p>In musical comedy the high-water mark of popularity was attained by
<em>The Geisha</em> in 1896, but though <em>Punch</em> speaks handsomely of Mr.
Jones's tuneful numbers&mdash;as they deserved&mdash;he makes it clear that the
success of the piece was chiefly due to the talent and humour of the
performers&mdash;Marie Tempest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span> Letty Lind; Monkhouse, Huntley Wright
and Hayden Coffin. In 1907 the devastating popularity of <em>The Merry
Widow</em> amounted, in <em>Punch's</em> view, as expressed in his "Dirge" on the
waltz of that name, to a tyranny rather than a delight; and in the
spring of 1913 he was moved to protest, in the name of Music, against
the wholesale importation of American coon songs, "Hitchy Koo!" and
rag-time generally.</p>

<p>In the middle 'nineties the banjo was still fashionable, and the
amateur singer a source of grief and wonderment to <em>Punch</em>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">WHY DOST THOU SING?</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w30"><div class="stanza">

<p class="i0">Then wherefore should'st thou visit us for ever</p>
<p class="i12">With thy one song?</p>
</div></div></div>

<p><em>Punch</em> gave it up; but in 1910 he declared that "one of the finest
efforts accomplished by the gramophone has been the obliteration of the
inferior amateur singer."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Pioneers and Prodigies</em></div>

<p>The musical education of the million advanced apace. No more potent
agency for the diffusion of a taste for orchestral music has existed
in our times than the Promenade Concerts, directed since 1895 by
Sir Henry Wood. The creation of this new audience is described with
sympathy and delightful humour in <em>The Promenade Ticket</em> by the late
and deeply lamented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span> Arthur Hugh Sidgwick. While recognizing these new
and beneficent activities, <em>Punch</em> did not forget the splendid pioneer
work done by forerunners&mdash;notably Sir August Manns, whose seventieth
birthday in 1895 is affectionately celebrated in punning verse. The
action of the L.C.C. in 1897, which threatened to put a stop to the
Queen's Hall Sunday Concerts, reawakened <em>Punch's</em> anti-Sabbatarian
zeal. Not much account is taken of serious native composers, but the
rise of Elgar's "star" is acknowledged as early as 1904 in the picture
of Richter conducting <em>The Dream of Gerontius</em>.</p>

<p class="center">A SHOW OF HANS</p>
<p class="center">(Richter interprets Elgar's <em>Dream</em>.)</p>
</div>

<p>In 1903 <em>Punch</em> was seriously perturbed by the glut of prodigies, and
in a cartoon addresses the child violinist, "Get thee to a <em>nursery</em>.
Go!" Yet in 1905, though "not as a rule favourably inclined to infant
phenomena," he makes an exception in favour of the thirteen-year-old
Mischa Elman. In 1908, in a burlesque account of "A Day in the Life of
a Strenuous Statesman," the diarist records his reply to a Socialist
Member that "the Government would think not once but twice before they
refused to grant special pensions to the parents of infant prodigies
earning less than £5,000 a year." On the compulsory musical teaching
of the ingenuous youth <em>Punch</em> held views which may be gathered from
his picture in 1911 of the unhappy small boy at the pianoforte, with
the legend: "The only thing that comes between us, Mother, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span> this
wretched music!" While <em>Punch</em> was benevolent to the little musician,
he was decidedly hostile to the cult of bigness in musical scores and
instrumentation, and more than once assails the prevalent "Jumbomania"
as illustrated by huge bands and the extravagant explosion of all the
sonorities. When Strauss in 1903 was the <em>dernier cri</em> of modernism,
<em>Punch</em> addressed him in perversion of a much-parodied model:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">

<div class="sidenote"><em>Elegies and Eulogies</em></div>
<p>Many heroes and heroines of the Victorian musical world passed away
in these years. I have already spoken of Sullivan, but may note the
tribute to Rubinstein in 1894 and the song to Sims Reeves in 1895,
in which <em>Punch</em>, who had on occasion handled him severely for his
failures to fulfil his engagements, was now only concerned to chronicle
the triumphs, in ballad and oratorio, of "the king of the tenor tribe"
who had fallen in old age on evil days. Sims Reeves, when well over
seventy, had been reduced to singing in the Music-Halls, and in 1897
<em>Punch</em> cordially supported the appeal for funds issued by the <em>Daily
Telegraph</em>. The results of this public subscription, supplemented by a
Civil List pension, helped to relieve his few remaining years.</p>

<p>Corney Grain's death in 1895 removed the most popular musical
"entertainer" of the time. <em>Punch</em>, in his farewell salute, gave him
the highest possible praise by describing him as having successfully
succeeded to John Parry. In 1896 <em>Punch</em> bestowed the bâton of musical
Field-Marshal on Lieut. Dan Godfrey on his retirement from the post of
bandmaster to the Grenadier Guards, which he had held for fifty years.
Dan Godfrey was the first bandmaster who ever held a commission in the
army, and had rendered conspicuous service to the cause of military
music. <em>Punch's</em> honour was well merited, and Dan Godfrey's son, Dan
the Second, conductor of the admirable Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra
for nearly thirty years, has added fresh lustre to the family name. In
the same year <em>Punch</em> records the presentation, at Marlborough House,
of a testimonial to Lady Hallé (Madame Norman Néruda). His account
of the proceedings border on the burlesque, but there is nothing but
admiration for the brilliant artist who had delighted British audiences
ever since the days of her <em>début</em> as a prodigy nearly fifty years
before, and who had been one of the glories of the "Pops" in their
golden prime. Nor did <em>Punch</em> forget to add his congratulations to
Henry Bird when that fine artist, respected and loved by all who knew
him, celebrated his Jubilee in 1910:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w32"><div class="stanza">

<p class="i8">Whom trifles oft provoke</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
<p class="i0">To sudden fury or unseemly tears;</p>

<p class="i0">And by melodious memories rarely stirred,</p>
<p class="i0"><em>Punch</em> hails your Jubilee, O tuneful Bird!</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>The author of those lines, on another occasion, rendered Mr. Bird a
serious disservice. <em>A propos</em> of the invasion of the Music-Halls by
serious performers, he had published a purely fictitious announcement
that Mr. Henry Bird would shortly appear on the Variety stage as
"The Terrible Transposer"&mdash;an allusion to his notorious skill in
that direction. This was copied into the parish magazine of St.
Mary Abbot's, Kensington, where Mr. Bird had been for many years
organist, but the editor's ironical comment was misinterpreted, and
the announcement was taken seriously, with the result that Mr. Bird
was bombarded with inquiries from applicants for the post. A man with
a less angelic temper would have been annoyed; but Mr. Bird was only
amused.</p>

<h2><a name="SPORT_AND_PASTIME" id="SPORT_AND_PASTIME">SPORT AND PASTIME</a></h2>

<p>The chronicles of sport and pastime from the early 'nineties down
to the outbreak of the War are one long and instructive commentary
on the old saying that in the long run the pupil always beats his
master. At the opening of this period, though assailed in the domain
of athletic sports by the Americans, and in that of cricket by the
Australians, Great Britain still led the world in games and most
forms of sport. At its close there was no form of organized physical
effort, whether individual or collective, in which we had not been
effectively challenged or defeated by the superior skill or endurance
of competitors from overseas. In cricket, football, rowing, golf, polo,
yachting, lawn tennis and boxing, we had met our match and more than
our match; and the insular complacency which prevailed in the 'nineties
had given place in certain minds to a mood of depression, made vocal in
the Duke of Westminster's letter to <em>The Times</em> in the autumn of 1913,
in which he described our failure to take the Olympic games seriously
and the loss of championships as "a national disaster." In the interval
sport and pastime had become an international preoccupation. <em>Punch</em> in
earlier years had been strongly in favour of international contests as
a means of promoting international good will. He was not so certain on
this point by 1913, but it is to his credit that he viewed the whole
subject in its true perspective, recognizing that the spirit in which a
game was played was a truer test of sportsmanship than the achievement
of success; that the best sportsmen were "good losers"; and, above
all, that national efficiency did not vary directly with the number of
athletic championships collected by the nation. As early as 1892 these
principles emerge in his reference to a boat-race at Andrésy on the
Seine, when the English crew were defeated by the French. The title of
the verses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span> "Froggie would a-rowing go," is not promising but their
spirit is excellent:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w36"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">For in spite of the brag and the bounce and the chaff,</p>
<p class="i10">Heigho for Rowing!</p>
<p class="i0">The Frog beat the Bull by a length and a half,</p>
<p class="i0">With your Mossop and James, licked by Boudin and Cuzin,</p>
<p class="i10">Heigho! says R. C. Lehmann!</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>So in 1893 he hailed the appearance of the French crew at Henley:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w36"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0"><em>Punch</em> greets you with cheers, may your shades ne'er diminish,</p>
<p class="i0">Though you row forty-four from the start to the finish.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Only friendship could result from such contests. At the same time,
in "The British Athlete's Vade-Mecum," he rebukes his countrymen's
contempt for the foreigner's idea of sport. When Oxford beat Yale in
the inter-University sports in 1894, <em>Punch</em> was wise enough to foresee
that the triumph was not final:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w36"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Come again, Yale, come again, and again;</p>
<p class="i0">Victors or vanquished such visits aren't vain.</p>
<p class="i0">One of these days you will probably nick us.</p>
<p class="i0">We don't crow when we lick; we won't cry when you lick us!</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>A similar spirit animates the cartoon on the Cambridge and Harvard
boat-race in 1906, in which Father Thames, as "The Jolly Waterman,"
takes pride in both crews, while the accompanying verses on "Light Blue
and Crimson" emphasize that <em>camaraderie</em> of rowing which the writer,
"R. C. L.," did so much to foster. The races for the America Cup
were, in their earlier stages, when Lord Dunraven was the challenger,
more productive of friction than cordiality. Sir Thomas Lipton's
indefatigable persistence in his efforts to "lift the Cup" from 1901
onward does not pass unacknowledged, but <em>Punch's</em> consolation is not
free from irony:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w36"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Bear up, Sir T.; remember Bruce's spider;</p>
<p class="i2">Build further <em>Shamrocks</em> through the coming-years;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Cups, Championships and Olympic Games</em></div>

<p>So an element of ridicule is not wanting in the burlesque diaries
published in 1903 of "Lipton Day by Day" and "Lipton Minute by Minute,"
or in the mock-heroic cartoon of Sir Thomas as "The Last of the Vikings
and the First of the Tea-kings."</p>

<p>Lawn tennis in the middle 'nineties was still a predominantly British
pastime. In his account of the Northern Tournament in 1895 not a
single American or foreign competitor is named, and <em>Punch</em> bewails
the absence of the old heroes, the Renshaws and Lawford, and the
defection of Miss Lottie Dod, who had already given up lawn tennis for
golf. In 1906 the prowess of Miss May Sutton, the American girl who
carried off the Ladies' Championship at Wimbledon, is celebrated in
eulogistic "Limericks." But it was still a far cry to the Wimbledon of
even seven years later, when French and German, as well as American
and Australian players, entered the arena. Uncle Sam had been busy
collecting championships in the interval, and in August, 1913,
<em>Punch</em> represented him, carrying a model yacht, a tennis racket and
a polo stick (he might have added a golf club in view of Mr. Travis's
triumph at Sandwich in 1904), saying to a rather rueful-looking John
Bull in cricketing costume: "Say, John, what's this game, anyway?
Cricket? Well, see here; mail me a copy of the rules, with date of
next international championship. I'm just crazy on Cups." The Olympic
Games <em>furore</em> left <em>Punch</em> cold. The Duke of Westminster's letter on
the "national disaster" of 1912 prompts a satirical cartoon in which
John Bull, "prostrate with shame," remarks: "My place in the Council
of Europe may be higher than ever, but what's the use of that when
the Olympic palm for the kneeling high jump is borne by another?" The
"Olympic Catechism," published in the following number, is a bitter but
not wholly undeserved criticism of the spirit, organization and results
of these contests, and the evasion by their promoters of the difficulty
of discriminating between professionals and amateurs. To the question,
"How is the Olympic spirit acquired?" <em>Punch</em> supplies the following
answer:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>A.</em> By taking part in the Olympic games; by subscribing to the
Duke of Westminster's fund; by devoting oneself to the discovery of
champions; by advertising; by organizing a boom; by promising <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>a
public reception to successful athletes; by paying their expenses;
by&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> I see. Then I suppose Great Britain has no athletics at present?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> No, none of the right sort.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What is the right sort?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> The sort that is imbued with the Olympic spirit.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Does everybody like the Olympic spirit?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Yes, everybody who is anybody.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> But if somebody says he dislikes it?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> Then he is a crank.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> What is a crank?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> One who has not got the Olympic spirit.</p>

<p><em>Q.</em> Are the subscriptions coming in?</p>

<p><em>A.</em> I refuse to answer further questions.</p></blockquote>

<p>The search for Olympic talent inspired a succession of burlesque
pictures; and the fostering of the "Olympic Spirit" is reduced to
absurdity by the drawing of the lady presenting a classic wreath to the
winner of the sack-race in some village sports.</p>

<p>The introduction of base-ball in 1892 is chronicled pictorially in
a grotesque illustration of the attitudes of the players. But the
interest now taken in the game, and reflected in the publication of
"base-ball results" on the tape and in the sporting columns of the
Press, was essentially a post-war product. Cricket reigned paramount
in <em>Punch's</em> affections, at any rate in the 'nineties. When Mr. C. I.
Thornton was presented with a silver trophy during the Scarborough Week
in 1894, as a memento of the great part he had taken in the Scarborough
Festival since its institution in 1869, <em>Punch</em> paid lyrical homage
to "Buns," the "great slogger of sixes." The Preface to vol. cviii.
(1895) is headed by a picture of <em>Punch</em>, "W. G." and the shade of
Alfred Mynn. Reference is made in the text to the National Testimonial
to Grace which was got up this year, and <em>Punch</em> suggests that "W. G."
ought to receive a knighthood. He was not alone in the suggestion, for
<em>The Times</em> subsequently referred to "Dr. W. G. Grace, whose name has
been everywhere of late&mdash;except where it might well have been, in the
Birthday Honours List," and <em>Punch</em> improved on the text in June:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Gentleman and Players</em></div>

sport-loving race. By Jove! "Sir William Gilbert Grace" Sounds
splendid. <em>Punch</em> says, "<em>Knight him!</em>"</p></blockquote>

<p>In the same summer "W. G." is glorified in "The Cricket Three":&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Men of one skill though varying in race,</p>
<p class="i0">Maclaren, Ranjitsinhji, Grand Old Grace.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ranji was "champion cricketer" of the year in 1896, and <em>Punch</em>
indited an "Ode to the Black Prince" with a portrait by Sambourne.
Yet the cricket world was not without its frictions and difficulties.
In this year the professionals had claimed a higher rate of pay than
the regulation £10 for taking part in matches against Australia, and
<em>Punch</em> intervenes in a cartoon in which he gives Grace, Abel and Trott
the toast of the Three F's&mdash;"Fair Play, Fair Pay and Friendliness."
<em>Punch</em> a year earlier had congratulated the Committee of the Rugby
Union on their decision that "Professionalism was illegal," thus
showing their determination to "keep the ball out of the Moneygrub's
sordid slime." But while he deplored the prospect of strikes and
lock-outs in the cricket world, he clearly held that here, at any rate,
the status of the professional was securely established and deserved
considerate treatment. England won the rubber, rather unexpectedly,
in 1896, and <em>Punch</em> singles out Grace, Peel, Hearne and Abel for
special honour. The English visiting team were defeated in Australia in
the winter of 1898, and <em>Punch</em>, in his "Eleven Little Reasons Why,"
genially satirizes those critics who tried to explain it away:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because of course they play cricket in Australia all the year round.</p>

<p>Because it was too hot for anything, and of course the English team
were unaccustomed to the heat.</p>

<p>Because there was a chapter of accidents from the first, and everyone
had bad luck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>Because the coin never would come down the right side on the top, and
consequently the British could not go in first.</p>

<p>Because the ground got hopelessly out of order by the time that the
first innings of the Australians was over.</p>

<p>Because the constant travelling and occasional <em>fêting</em> were enough to
put everyone out of form.</p>

<p>Because there ought to have been more extra men to fill up the ranks
on emergencies.</p>

<p>Because at least one admirable cricketer was left at home whose
services on several occasions would have been invaluable.</p>

<p>Because the tea interval coming after the luncheon pause was confusing
to the Mother Countrymen.</p>

<p>Because the glorious uncertainty of cricket is proverbial, and success
may be deserved, but cannot on that account be always attained.</p>

<p>Lastly, and probably the right reason, because the other side had the
better men.</p></blockquote>

<p>Loving cricket as he did <em>Punch</em> was yet fully alive to the English
tendency to think that success with the bat or ball qualified a man
for anything, and made good capital out of a letter in <em>The Times</em> in
1899, in which the writer, "LL.B. and M.A., London," had written of the
late Sir Michael Foster, then a candidate for the representation of the
University in Parliament: "Michael Foster was a capital cricketer. He
kept wicket for the first eleven.... No better candidate could possibly
be found." I have elsewhere noted his reference to the clergyman who
in the same year had declared that what his village really needed in
a curate was "a good fast bowler with a break from the off." Towards
the new type of cricketing journalist which emerged about the close
of the century <em>Punch</em> was not exactly benevolent; the duplication
of functions was remunerative, but could not conduce to impartial
reporting when the writer was also a performer. In the last ten years
of this period <em>Punch's</em> references to cricket are much less frequent,
but we may note his excellent Latin joke in 1906 on the discomfiture of
the Players at Lord's&mdash;<em>urgentur ... longa Nocte</em>, i.e. by long Knox,
the famous amateur fast bowler. The triumph of Warwickshire&mdash;champion
county in 1911&mdash;is commemorated in the cartoon, "Two Gentlemen of
Warwickshire," with the ingenious legend:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. F. R. Foster</span> (Captain of the Warwickshire XI): "Tell Kent
from me she hath lost." (II Henry VI, iv, 10.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Shakespeare</span>: "Warwick, thou art worthy!" (III Henry
VI, iv, 6.)</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Lord's and Ladies</em></div>

<p>Cricket was increasingly played by girls, but both at the beginning and
the end of the period the female spectator left much to be desired.
After the Oxford and Cambridge match in 1896 <em>Punch</em> wrote some verses
on the attraction of "Lord's" for ladies, which end on a note of severe
remonstrance:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w28"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">If, Phyllis, you your place <em>must</em> take</p>
<p class="i2">Between me and the wicket,</p>
<p class="i0">Don't chatter, and for goodness' sake</p>
<p class="i2">Sit still and watch the cricket.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>In 1912 appeared the picture, "At the Eton and Harrow Match." Here an
"important lady" addresses deep square-leg, standing near the boundary,
"Would you kindly move away? It's quite impossible for my daughter to
see my nephew, who is batting."</p>

</div>

<p>If cricket claims less notice in <em>Punch's</em> pages, it must not be taken
to imply any lessening of his love. The reason is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span> be found in the
richer field for satire and ridicule provided by other pastimes. The
immense development of Association football as a spectacular game,
and the wholesale importation of hireling players to represent a
district to which they did not belong, found no favour with <em>Punch</em>.
His picture of Football Fever in the Midlands on Saturday afternoon in
1892 is deliberately grotesque and hostile. By 1904 the achievements of
the Dominions and of Wales in the Rugby game lend point to <em>Punch's</em>
burlesque forecast of the "Football of the Future." International
matches are to be "refereed" by well-known statesmen; Esperanto is to
be spoken; and Great Britain is represented by a team of fourteen New
Zealanders and one Welshman. In 1910 a weekly paper advocated weeping
for men as "the true elixir of energy and the greatest of Nature's
restoratives." This pronouncement was turned to good account in "A
Cup Tie Episode," relating how a team, with three&mdash;love against them
at half-time, turned the tables on their opponents after a copious
outburst of tears. Again, when a daily paper in 1913 conducted a
referendum amongst its readers to ascertain what subjects of public
interest were insufficiently treated in its columns, <em>Punch</em> asserts
that "to the Editor's question 465,326 readers replied, football;
235,473, golf; 229,881, flying; and 2, foreign politics." The burlesque
snapshots published in the same year if reprinted to-day would hardly
be an exaggeration of the latest inanities of the camera in the
football field.</p>

<p>While <em>Punch</em> might plead guilty to an "insufficient treatment" of
professional football, and glory in his guilt, he could not be charged
with a similar neglect of golf. As a solace to the unsuccessful lady
lawn-tennis player it is recommended, as early as 1894, in an audacious
travesty of Goldsmith:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sacrilegious hands are laid on Mrs. Browning, in 1902, in the lament
of "The Golf Widows"&mdash;i.e. women whose husbands do nothing but play or
talk golf&mdash;an excellent satire on the selfishness, the "shop," and the
strong language of the "strong man off his game." But there are golfers
and golfers; and <em>Punch</em> recognized one of the real heroes of the game
in his "Royal and ancient friend," old Tom Morris, whose resignation
of his post as green-keeper at St. Andrew's inspired this genial
salutation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w32"><div class="stanza">

<p>The popularity of golf in France has led to the framing of a complete
glossary of French equivalents for the terminology of the game.
<em>Punch</em>, as a good humanist, essayed a similar task<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span> at a time when the
revival of Latin for conversational purposes was proposed by some hardy
classicists. As he justly remarks: "The advantages of Latin in this
context will not have escaped the notice of even the most superficial
observers. Thus the bad effect on caddies of using strong language in
the vernacular is entirely obviated. Again, when the ball is lying
dead, only a dead language can render justice to the situation."</p>

<p>Of the brief vogue of bicycling among the "smart set" I have spoken
already. The abuse of this indispensable machine inspired a new version
of "Daisy Bell, or a Bicycle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span> Made for Two"&mdash;"Blazy Bill or the Bicycle

<p>As a set-off, however, in "<em>Facilis Descensus</em>" <em>Punch</em> sings gaily
and genially of the "dear little Bishop" who had bought a new "bike"
and found that in the joys of the wheel nothing could come up to
"coasting." The picture of Mr. Gladstone on the old "ordinary" is not a
representation of fact, but I print it as a reminder of the appearance
of that remarkable and perilous-looking machine. Croquet, which had led
a submerged existence for several years, reasserted itself in 1894, and
<em>Punch</em>, in affected astonishment, asked, "Are we back in the 'sixties
again?" The revival was attributed by the <em>Pall Mall Gazette</em> to the
abolition of "tight croqueting," a phrase which gave <em>Punch</em> openings
for facetious comment. In the previous year he had disrespectfully
spoken of croquet as the "feeblest game," and yet admitted that, given
a pretty partner, it beat golf and polo. Swimming, in its heroic
form, loomed large in 1905, and in <em>Punch's</em> picture the Channel is
black with male and female athletes, while an article is devoted to
a fictitious account of an hotel at Dover specially equipped to meet
their needs. Women had by now taken so kindly to all kinds of sport and
pastime that <em>Punch</em> sought to reduce their competition to absurdity in
the dialogue of two stalwart young men who preferred arranging flowers
to shooting or golfing, because they had become "so effeminate." The
sporting woman, by the way, was no favourite of Du Maurier's. Ten years
earlier he had portrayed an odious specimen of the new womanhood in
Miss Goldenberg, who, in reply to the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span> of the charming vicar's
wife whether she had had good sport, replies jauntily: "Oh, rippin'! I
only shot one rabbit, but I managed to injure quite a dozen more!" The
"Ballad of the Lady Hockey-player" in 1903 ascribes to her a distinctly
matrimonial purpose:&mdash;</p>

<p>Winter sports in Switzerland make their <em>début</em> in <em>Punch</em> in 1895 in
an article on tobogganing dated "<em>Canton des Grisons</em>." Mention is
made of curling, "bandy" and figure-skating, but nothing is said of
ski-ing, which though practised as a sport in Norway from 1860, did
not reach Switzerland till the end of the century. Another foreign
importation, this time from Japan, was ju-jitsu, to the value of which
<em>Punch</em> pays a dubious tribute in 1899 in a burlesque interview with a
burglar on whom a householder had ineffectually tried the new art of
self-defence. In the same mood are the farcical suggestions for dealing
with various awkward situations in 1905, and the overthrow of a butler
by a page-boy, to the petrifaction of the servants' hall. There was
a recrudescence of roller-skating in 1909 which <em>Punch</em> deals with
in pictures, prose and verse. The inexpert and self-protective lover
sings, after Ben Jonson:&mdash;</p>

<p>There are many allusions to "Rinkomania," but not nearly so many as to
Ping-Pong, which attained the proportions of a pestilence in 1901, 1902
and 1903. <em>Punch</em> began by calling it a "ghastly game," but kept in
close touch with its progress until the tyranny was overpast. He gives
us pictures of ping-pong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span> in the kitchen; of people searching beneath
the table and in corners for missing balls; a sketch of a ping-pong

<div class="poetry">

<p class="i0">Here you may learn if it is true</p>
<p class="i0">That Tosher's got his Ping-Pong Blue.</p>

<p>The epidemic abated in 1903, and in "The Lost Golfer" <em>Punch</em> has
some excellent chaff (after Browning) of the "parlour hero," his mind
temporarily unhinged by a "piffulent game." The verses begin "Just for
a celluloid pilule he left us," and end with the anticipation that the
"lost golfer" will yet return to his old haunts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w32"><div class="stanza">

<p class="i2">Back from the lunatic lure of Ping-Pong.</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Ping-pong departed, to be revived in 1920, but another and equally
devastating craze ran its course in 1907, when "Diabolo"&mdash;the old
"Devil-on-two-sticks"&mdash;was the ruling passion of the hour. It was
honoured with a cartoon showing John Redmond playing the "Divil of
a Game," the reel being "Leadership," and numerous illustrations
are devoted to the progress of the mania. <em>Punch</em> affected to have
discovered a new disease, "Diabolo Neck," which he compares and
contrasts with "the Cheek of the Devil," and records the observation
of an ill-tempered old gentleman, as he watched some performers
"diabolizing" in Kensington Gardens: "A month or so ago that sort of
thing was only being done in our Asylums."</p>

<p>The vogue of Bridge dates from the last years of the old century.
According to the veracious <em>Daily Mail</em>, in 1899 a Cambridge Professor
was earning handsome fees by giving instruction in the game to members
of the University, and <em>Punch</em> embroiders the text according to his
wont. In 1901 <em>Punch's</em> cartoon "Discarded" shows Fashion, in her
fool's cap, accosting "Mr. Bridge": "Come along, Partner! That dear
old Mister Whist is such a bore! He is so <em>vieux jeu</em>!" Bridge figures
as a gallant and picturesque cavalier, while Whist is a sour-visaged
old pedant. <em>Punch</em> was not always of one mind about the triumphant
new-comer, but he cordially echoed the sentiments of the <em>Morning
Post</em> when that journal asserted that Bridge made for the abolition
of the drawing-room ballad and the drawing-room ballad-monger; and it
gave him abundant scope for comment and parody, e.g. his perversion of
Longfellow's lines into "I played on at Bridge at midnight." Bridge,
however, had not always a monopoly of attraction even in the days when
its tyranny was at its height. In 1902 we encounter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span> the tragedy of
the four men driven to the nursery to play Bridge because "they are
playing Ping-Pong in the dining-room, and 'Fives' in the billiard-room,
Jack's trying to imitate Dan Leno in the drawing-room, Dick's got that
infernal gramophone of his going in the hall, and they are laying
supper in the smoking-room."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Hunting and Prize-fighting</em></div>

<p>It is a relief to turn from these mostly futile indoor pastimes to the
robuster sports of the chase, the turf and the prize-ring. <em>Punch</em>
was fortunate in this period in having at his command, in Mr. Armour,
an artist who restored the hunting pictures to a higher level of
draughtsmanship than they had ever reached before. This implies no
disparagement of the incomparable geniality of Leech's drawings, which
in that respect have never been equalled, unless by Randolph Caldecott.
But for the correct drawing of hounds, horses and riders, and for the
discreet handling of the hunting landscape, Mr. Armour's equipment
is above reproach. References to the turf in the early years of this
period are mostly connected with Lord Rosebery. His success in winning
the Derby with <em>Ladas</em> in 1894 lends point to the "highly improbable
anticipation" of <em>Punch's</em> artist in which the Premier, in parson's
garb, announces his conversion to the tenets of the Nonconformist
conscience. In September of the same year we have the wail of a
"disgusted backer" over the defeat of the favourite in the St. Leger:&mdash;</p>

<p>In a more serious vein of irony <em>Punch</em>, in 1906, muses on the
popularity of the turf and ends with this reflection:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem w30"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Is it not odd that hitherto no poet</p>
<p class="i2">Has thought to mention how, with lord and serf,</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
<p class="i0">Whether they plunge thereon, or rest below it,</p>

<p>The problem of the future of the horse exercises <em>Punch</em> in 1911. Mr.
Morrow's suggestions are always original, if fantastic, but he is on
safe ground when he declares that the horse could always be of use in
pageants. Motor-cars in ceremonial processions remind one of nothing so
much as huge beetles.</p>

<p>The great revival of boxing came at the end of the period, but in 1908
there is an amusing reference to Jack Johnson who, after defeating
Tommy Burns, had become very unpopular in New South Wales, but,
according to the <em>Daily Mail</em>, found consolation for adverse criticism
in reading Shakespeare, Milton and Bunyan. The statement was not thrown
away on <em>Punch</em>, who, while welcoming the evidence that Jack Johnson
was able to keep his temper sweet, observed that it would be sweeter
still to know what Shakespeare, Milton and Bunyan thought of his
devotion. On the eve of the War, as I have noted in the first chapter,
the man in the street was thinking a good deal more about Carpentier
than the Crown Prince Franz Ferdinand.</p>
